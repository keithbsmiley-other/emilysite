I started writing this article about superfoods -- a general topic I figured would have a bunch of different categories that I could break down. But, the more I researched superfoods, the more I realized that superfoods are just healthy foods. Superfoods are literally just fruits and vegetables. It’s not rocket science, to be frank. The foods that are best for us are *spoiler alert* the foods that we already know are best for us.

That being said, I’m not going to sit here and write about why legumes, dark leafy greens, and oats are healthy. Other than to say they are the most packed with vitamins, minerals, and overall healthy things that make our bodies run as smoothly and efficiently as possible. And, honestly, I feel like I’ve pretty much already covered a lot of that in [my article about macros](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/fad-diets-and-macros). 

If you came here for a basic list of superfoods, I must say two things:
1. Have you read any of my other blogs? I don’t do short lists. This is long form research, baby!
2. If you do want a list of superfoods, go [here](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/get-smart-about-superfoods-infographic).[^1]

Okay, now that that’s out of our way. We are going to zoom in a little bit. 

There is one molecule found within “superfoods” that I’d like to talk about: Antioxidants. I want to discuss antioxidants mostly because I feel like the word “superfood” is thrown onto food labels without a proper understanding of what the word actually means. Most of these food marketing terms can be absolute bullshit. [^2]

## Antioxidants
So, what are Antioxidants?

According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, antioxidants are “man-made or natural substances that may prevent or delay some types of cell damage.”[^3] 

What is the cause of the cell damage?

Free radicals.

## What Are Free Radicals?

Okay, let’s address the elephant in the room: Free Radicals is a great name for an 80s punk band.[^4] 

Alas, that’s not what we’re here to discuss today. 

In order to understand what free radicals actually are, we have to have a little chemistry talk. Don’t be scared. We’ll get through this together.

At the most basic level, the human body is made of four fundamental types of particles. We’re going to talk about one of those particles: Electrons.[^5] Electrons create electrical currents. “It is the quantity and distribution of electrons around the outside of atoms that determine how they will behave chemically.”[^6]
 
So, electrons orbit an atom in layers. Scientist call these layers, shells. Every shell must be filled by a specific set of electrons. Once the shell is full, electrons fill the next shell.[^7] 

_Medical News Today_ notes, “If an atom has an outer shell that is not full, it may bond with another atoms, using the electrons to complete the outer shell. These types of atoms are known as free radicals.”[^8] 

Free radicals are unstable. In an effort to make up for their lacking electrons, they bond quickly with other substances.[^9]

> “When oxygen molecules split into single atoms that have unpaired electrons, they become unstable free radicals that seek other atoms or molecules with which to bond. If this continues to happen, it begins a process called oxidative stress.”[^10]

## What Causes The Production of Free Radicals & Oxidative Stress?

There are two different variables that can cause oxidative stress in the body.

1. Being A Normal Human - Our bodies produce free radicals as it breaks down nutrients to create energy. Our bodies have to do this or we would would not survive. The older we get, the more free radicals our body has produced.[^11]
2. DNA Damage brought on by outside sources - It has been shown that other outside sources brought into the body, like chemical carcinogens, can create free radicals.[^12] (More on this in a bit.)

## What Does Oxidative Stress Cause?

A normal part of being a human is aging, right? Right. Free radicals might be the cause of many symptoms of aging like:
- Skin elasticity 
- Wrinkles
- Graying hair 
- Hair loss
- Changes in hair texture[^13] 

_Medical News Today_ mentions a study with rats that showed a “significant increase in free radicals as the rats aged. These changes matched up with age-related declines in health.”[^14]

So, some of these side effects of free radicals, such as symptoms of aging, are normal within the human body. It’s going to happen, no matter how hard we try to make it stop.

Oxidative stress can also lead to diseases such as:

- Alzheimer’s and other dementias[^15]
- Cardiovascular disease due to clogged arteries
- Autoimmune and Inflammatory Disorders, like Rheumatoid Arthritis
- Cataracts and age-related vision decline
- Diabetes
- Genetic degenerative diseases, like Huntington’s or Parkinson’s[^16]

But wait there’s more.

> DNA and RNA are susceptible to oxidative damage.[^17] 

According to an article on DNA damage in _Current Opinion in Toxicology_, “DNA damage is any modification to the structure of DNA that alters its coding properties and/or interferes with cell processes.”[^18] 

In laymen’s terms: DNA damage can lead to “mutations and genomic instability”.[^19] This can ultimately lead to a “variety of cancers including colon, breast, and prostate cancer.”[^20] Most commonly, DNA damage caused by oxidative stress “ is formed and enhanced most by chemical carcinogens”.[^21] The most common sources of chemical carcinogens include:
- Tabacco
- Asbestos
- Radon
- Formaldehyde
- Ultraviolet Rays
- Alcohol (“Experts suggest women have no more than one drink a day; men no more than two.)
- Processed Meat (Bacon, salami, pepperoni, sausage—any meat that’s been preserved or flavored.)
- Engine Exhaust
- Pollution[^22]

> TL;DR: DNA damage brought on by oxidative stress caused by an increase of unstable free radicals in the body can lead to most cancers. 

## The Free Radical 1-2 Punch

The free radical one-two punch is the culmination of our normal bodily behavior, aging, in addition to the DNA damage caused by environmental carcinogenic sources. Free radical exposure and oxidative stress is literally impossible to avoid. It’s part of the process of the human body. However, it is the compounding of free radicals naturally made in the body *and* what we put into our bodies over decades—through the respiratory system such as asbestos and pollution or the digestive system such as alcohol and processed meat—that truly puts us at a higher risk for certain diseases and cancers.

That is part of the reasons why we see most cancers, types of dementia, cataracts, etc in older people. The average age for early Alzheimer’s symptoms is 60 years old. The average age for diagnosis is about 80 years old.[^23] Otherwise healthy seniors are also at a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes.[^24] Cataracts, on average, being to develop in the human eye around 40 years of age, and impair vision by 60 years of age.[^25] And, finally, rheumatoid arthritis typically sets in between 30 and 60 years of age.[^26]

I fully acknowledge there are a slew of factors that go into getting any of these diseases. However, my point is this: Free radical build up takes time. 

It’s not like you have one beer or smoke one cigarette, and you have damaged your DNA beyond repair. 

But, the more often you introduce carcinogens to your body, the more you’re increasing the amount of free radicals produced in your body, the more you are compounding the problem. Eventually, things can become beyond repair.

## I Thought We Were Talking About Antioxidants and Superfoods? Why Are You Scaring The Shit Out Of Me Instead?

All good points. Let me remind you: Knowledge is power. Now that you have knowledge, make better life choices. Or at least better understand the potential consequences of those choices.[^27]

> \#sorrynotsorry

Let me be clear here. There is no way that the human body has not: A. evolved some way to use free radicals to its advantage and B. Developed a way to help protect itself against free radicals. After all, the human body is built to survive. It is a machine that wants to keep on keeping on. 

## How the Body Uses Free Radicals To Its Advantage

According to _Understanding Antioxidants_, found on a blog hosted by Harvard Medical School, free radicals absolutely have a purpose. “When the immune system musters to fight intruders, for example, the oxygen it uses spins off an army of free radicals that destroy viruses, bacteria, and damaged body cells in an oxidative burst.”[^28] The production of free radicals are also necessary to “induce some of the beneficial effects of regular physical activity, such as sensitizing your muscle cells to insulin.”[^29]

But, like everything else, too much of a good thing can be corrosive. 

## How The Body Naturally Keeps Free Radical Numbers In Balance

Megan Ware, RDN, writes, “Antioxidants are substances that can prevent or slow damage to the cells caused by free radicals.”[^30] It is important to note here that the term “antioxidant” refers to a chemical property, not a nutritional substance.[^31]

According to _Understanding Antioxidants_, “Antioxidants neutralize free radicals by giving up some of their own electrons. In making this sacrifice, they act as a natural “off” switch for the free radicals. This helps break a chain reaction that can affect other molecules in the cell and other cells in the body.”[^32] Because of this, many scientists refer to antioxidants as “free radical scavengers.” 

Free radicals are extremely pervasive in the body. To maintain equilibrium, the body’s cells naturally produce antioxidants, such as glutathione, to neutralize free radicals or prevent them from being created within cells at all.[^33] 

Tobias Dick, researcher at the German Cancer Research Center, says, “‘We used to think that the more glutathione has oxidized in a cell, the more oxidative stress it produces. But we’ve noticed that this correlation is incorrect.’”[^34] Essentially, “cells are much more resistant and robust when it comes to oxidative stress than scientists had previously assumed.”[^35]

Our bodies create free radicals naturally. Our bodies can take care of free radicals naturally, to a point.[^36] What our bodies can’t deal with is an overwhelming amount of free radicals. 

> We have to put good shit in our bodies to counter for the bad shit we are also putting in our bodies.

We need to eat antioxidants.[^37] 

## Where Can We Find Antioxidants Environmentally?

Mostly fruits and vegetables.

According to Megan Dix, RN, “Eating five servings per day of a variety of fruits and vegetables is the best way to provide your body what it needs to produce antioxidants.”[^38]

What does our body need to create antioxidants?[^39]

- Vitamin E: Germ oil, whole grains, nuts, fruits, poultry, etc.
- Vitamin C: Acid fruits, green vegetables, tomatoes, 
- Beta-Carotene: Many fruits, grains, oil, and vegetables such as carrots, green plants, squash, and spinach
- Lycopene:  Mostly tomatoes[^40]
- Selenium: Found in garlic, onion, grains, nuts, sea food, meat, liver, yeast, etc.
- Flavonoids: Found in green tea, grapes (red wine), apple, cocoa (chocolate),  soybean, berries, broccoli, etc.
- Omega-3 & Omega-6 Fatty Acids: Fish, eggs, poultry, nuts, etc[^41]

One of the most important things to remember: 

> “Each antioxidant serves a different function and is not interchangeable with another. This is why is is important to have a varied diet.”[^42]

Another important thing to point out: This list included chocolate and red wine. 

Just sayin’.

## Supplements

According to Lynne Eldridge, MD, antioxidant supplements (nutrients in pill form rather than the food itself) don’t appear to have the same effect.[^43] 

> > “ An example is lung cancer. Knowing that people who had a higher intake of foods rich in beta-carotene and vitamin E had a lower risk of developing lung cancer, researchers conducted a study in which one group of people took a daily supplement of beta-carotene and the other did not. Men who smoked and took beta-carotene actually had a higher risk of developing lung cancer.”[^44]


Additionally, Megan Ware, RDN, notes, “The National Institutes of Health warn that high doses of antioxidant supplements can be harmful….A high dose of vitamin E has been found to increase the risk of prostate cancer, and the use of some antioxidant supplements has been linked to a greater risk of tumor growth.”[^45] It is also noted that some supplements can interfere with medications.[^46] 

Because of this, it is extremely important to speak with a health professional before  taking supplemental antioxidants.

In general: Try to eat your nutrients for antioxidants rather than taking supplements.

I want to make a note here as well about aging. Free radicals are a natural part of your body. It’s a part of the human cell process. So is aging. There are no supplements that will prevent us from aging. Antioxidant supplements are not going to stop you from getting wrinkles. Antioxidant supplements are not going to stop your hair from turning grey. 

Remember how I said marketing gimmicks around certain foods are bullshit (see “all natural”)? Yeah, well, it seems like antioxidant supplement food labels and marketing gimmicks fall in that category. 

> > “News articles, advertisements, and food labels often tout antioxidant benefits such as slowing aging, fending off heart disease, improving flagging vision, and curbing cancer. And laboratory studies and many large-scale observational studies…have noted antioxidant benefits from diets rich in them, particularly those coming from a broad range of colorful vegetables and fruits. But results from randomized controlled trials of antioxidant *supplements* (in which people are assigned to take specific nutrient supplements or a placebo) have not supported many of these claims. Indeed, too much of these antioxidant supplements won't help you and may even harm you. It is better to supply your antioxidants from a well-rounded diet.”[^47]

All we can do is try to age gracefully. We can do this by taking care of our bodies through appropriate exercise, mindful eating habits, and being aware of how many other carcinogenic chemicals we are putting in our bodies (pollution, tobacco, etc).

## Conclusion

Antioxidants alone do not prevent chronic conditions. 

Antioxidants can help us fight the free radicals that might be one of the causes for many disease, but they cannot prevent diseases entirely. Just like eating fruits, vegetables, and less red meat can lower our risk for heart disease, but it doesn’t definitively prevent us from getting heart disease. There are other variables to consider, such as genetics and other inherited predispositions.

And, just because free radicals are scary little shits, doesn’t mean we should over do it with supplements. Supplements might even make things worse. 

However, and I feel like most of my nutrition-based articles come back to this, if we eat cleanly (and by that I mean, if we eat fruits, vegetables, and clean proteins) we will, hopefully, be stacking the odds in our favor. 

I find it crazy that certain foods have to be labeled “superfood” just to make them appealing to us. These aren’t “superfoods”. They’re just healthy food. We already knew this. The fact that fruits and vegetables have antioxidants just prove the point further.

Fruits,  vegetables, and clean proteins (poultry and seafood namely), all have a place in our diet. We are omnivores for a reason. Humans evolved to eat a variety of foods—a variety of whole, unprocessed, foods.

> Kale farmers shouldn’t have to label their product as “super” just to get us to put it in our mouths. 

I get it, though. It feels like the food industry has actively been working against our health for, what feels like, at least a hundred years. That’s why I write articles like [this one](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/nutritional-fallout). 

Ultimately, it’s up to us to do the research. It’s up to us to put the correct thing in our bodies. It’s up to us to acknowledge that moderation is the key to everything.[^48]



[^1]:	When you google “list of superfoods” you can get a list as short as 5 items to as long as 25-30. Mostly because superfoods can simply be boiled down to most fruits and vegetables. That list can go on and on and on and on and…well, you get my point.

[^2]:	There are three different ways to see the term “organic” on a food label. 1. 100% organic means the product is made of only organic ingredients. 2. Organic means the product contains 95% or more organic ingredients. 3. Made with Organic Ingredients means the products contains 70% or more organic ingredients. Meaning 30% of the ingredients do not meet the “organic” standards.

	The term “natural” can appear on literally any food label as it is not regulated by the FDA.

	The term “grass-fed” means that the animal consumed grass versus grain or corn, however they’re not governmental regulation on how much or how often.

	The term “cage-free” means the chickens *could have* roamed outside of a cage, doesn’t necessarily mean they did or how often they did. 

	And finally, “pasture-raised” means the animal spent time on a pasture or outdoors for some amount of time, but again, it’s not regulated how long or how often.

	I feel a responsibility to note here that some of these diseases are also effected by genetics. Risk genes increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee that any one individual will get it. The Alzheimer’s Association notes, “Deterministic genes directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits one will develop a disorder.” Both of these types of genes can possibly cause diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s or Parkinson’s. If someone has a Risk gene for any of these diseases, however, free radicals may increase the chances of getting the disease.
