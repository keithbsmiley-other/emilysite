I appear to be on a nervous system kick. But honestly, can you blame me? The nervous system is responsible for literally every single movement we make. 

Right now you’re reading. Your nervous system is firing neurons around your body and brain to move your eyes and process the words you’re seeing into a language your brain understands.[^1]

Typing?

That’s your nervous system telling your fingers what to type based on the knowledge you’ve accumulated, *and* spelling every single word mostly “mindlessly”. 

Walking? 

That’s your nervous system telling your muscles to move in a very specific way in order to put one foot in front of the other. Do you know how many muscles are required to shift inside the tensegrity model that is your body just to walk?[^2]

What about walking from a paved parking lot to a sandy beach while sending a text message all at the same time? Now you’ve added spelling, reading, finger movement, walking, and proprioceptive awareness to not fall on your face because the ground is suddenly squishy and weird.

How about cooking dinner, and helping your kids with their homework?

Sure, statistically speaking the more we multitask the less efficient we really are at tasks, *but* without our nervous systems we might as well be amoebas.[^3]

> Fun fact: Neurons in the human body fire at speeds of about 270 miles per hour.[^4]

So, here’s my thought. If the nervous system is so important, how can I make *mine* more efficient through my movement.

I’m still pretty stuck on the concept of using the parasympathetic nervous system to control the sympathetic nervous system. If those words make no sense to you [read this](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/breathing) then continue down this rabbit hole with me. 

Don’t want to [read this](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/breathing#fn:11)?  Fine. Be that way.

### A Quick Recap:

The Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) controls our fight or flight response as well as meets other energy demands.

The Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) is a counter to the sympathetic nervous system. When the (SNS) is no longer needed, the parasympathetic nervous system helps bring other key systems of the body return to their resting/normal state.[^5]

## Body Homeostasis

Let’s talk about homeostasis. Emeritus Professor Kelvin Rodolfo of the University of Illinois defines homeostasis as, “any process that living things use to actively maintain fairly stable conditions necessary for survival.”[^6]

The best way to understand body homeostasis is to think about the temperature of the human body. The average human has a temperature of around 98.6 (plus or minus a few tenths of a degree). 

Our bodies regulate our temperatures in a variety of ways. For example, if we get too hot, we sweat to make more moisture available for evaporation. We might also grow flush as our small blood vessels automatically expand to bring more heated blood closes to the surface of the body so that it can cool.[^7]

If we get too cold, we sweat less, we we might shiver more, and, eventually, our blood circulation to the skin reduces to keep our more vital organ warmer. Therefore, our body is constantly trying to create homeostasis depending on the conditions of our environment.[^8]

There are all in all three types of homeostatic regulations in the human body.
1. Osmoregulation: Expels excess water, salts, and urea from the body.
2. Thermoregulating: Regulates the bodies temperature as previously discussed. 
3. Chemical Regulation: Releases insulin and glucagon into the blood to respond to rising and falling blood glucose levels, increases breathing to increase carbon dioxide in the blood, etc.[^9]

Still not quite getting it?

Okay, analogy time. Your body—just your body, the flesh bag in which you reside—is a car. 

You, as the car’s driver, are your body’s variety of systems that help create and maintain the three types of body homeostasis. If you drove the car without ever lifting your foot from the pedal or pressing onto the gas, and/or never turned the wheel as the road ahead requires, you will certainly crash into something.

That’s how body homeostasis works.

> Your body’s regulatory systems are constantly oscillating, moving back and forth, to allow for homeostasis, and, therefore, helping you to not crash.

## Great. How Is This Relevant To My Spine and Nervous System?

The nervous system is a huge part of creating and maintaining body homeostasis. After all, the nervous system is the communication highway of almost all things inside (and outside if you think of skin as outside) of us. 

It has been scientifically proven that a balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems is *required* for guaranteed body homeostasis.[^10] 

Think about it. 

If adrenal and cortisol are constantly being pumped into your blood stream, how can you calm down enough to say, oh I dunno, sleep — a key component of body regulation and homeostasis.[^11]

So, how can we work on this SNS/PNS balance?

## The Spine

When I was sequencing my yoga class today, I started really getting into the seven movements of the spine.[^12] I started to wonder if spinal movement affected the nervous system at all. After all, our spinal cord is the information super highway of our bodies.[^13] 

My [last article](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/breathing#fn:11) proved that we can stimulate the SNS and PNS through our breath, long muscular holds, and diaphragmatic breathing. So, the concept of physically working our spines in specific ways to stimulate balance between the PNS and SNS doesn’t seem that insane. Spinal movement to promote body homeostasis through SPB (sympathetic/parasympathetic balance) seems promising.

Turns out, I wasn’t the only one who had that thought.

In fact, a group of physiotherapists in Switzerland wrote, “Some studies showed that spinal manipulation may yield beneficial effects on SPB. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that TSM [thoracic spine mobilization] is feasible and could influence SPB reactions.”[^14]

Physiotherapists have been digging deeper into these studies because the SNS is associated with the experience of pain.[^15]  A group of researchers, Laura Kingston, Leica Sarah Claydon, and Steve Tumilty, reviewed several studies that looked into the effects of spinal mobilization and triggering the SNS. They found, “All studies demonstrated a consistent increase in sympathetic outcome measures, indicative of sympathetic excitation, irrespective of the segments mobilized. Synthesis of the results established strong evidence…for a positive change in skin conductance, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and heart rate among the healthy population.”[^16]

The real kicker for me though: “In the clinical context, this has important implications as sympathetic excitation occurs concurrently with hypoalgesia.”[^17]

### WTH Is Hypoalgesia?

Hypoalgesia is a decrease in sensitivity to painful stimuli. Hypoalgesia happens most often when painful stimuli are reduced somewhere along the neurological information highway. Essentially, hypoalgesia is when your brain isn’t told about, or can’t focus on, the pain you’re feeling. 

Think about stubbing your toe. What’s the first thing you do after you’ve whammed your little piggy against that dammed table leg? 

You gently touch that little piggy. And if it still hurts, you rub that little piggy.[^18] It’s one of the first life hacks we tell our kids after they’ve accidentally hurt themselves, isn’t it?

Why does it work, though?

> The more input you give your brain to think about, the less it can focus on acute pain. Multitasking is hard for our brains, remember?

This study might explain it better.

“In the study, cognitive neuro­scientist Marjolein Kammers of University College London and her colleagues asked blindfolded participants to place their index and ring fingers in tubs of warm water while their middle fingers rested in cool water, a common experimental trick that creates the illusion that the middle fingers are burning hot. When the participants withdrew from the water and touched only their middle fingers of both hands together or joined only their outer fingers, they found little relief. Touching all three fingers to an experimenter’s hand also failed to reduce pain. Only when the participants entwined their three affected fingers on both hands did they soothe themselves, diminishing perceived pain by 64 percent.” [^19]

If you’re all: “Great! I still don’t get it.”

“Uniting two parts of the same body…sends diverse signals to the brain about temperature, spatial position, and identify that can come only from self-contact. In this case, bringing all three fingers together probably provided the brain with enough comparative information to readjust its interpretation of skin temperature on her finger.”[^20]

I actually just saw a “challenge” on TikTok that might help further explain. 

Have someone close their eyes. 
Ask them: What does this sound like? 
Then you light a lighter.
They will answer, “It sounds like a lighter.”
With their eyes still closed, ask them: “Okay what does this feel like?”
Then you put an ice cube on their hand or arm.
They will freak out thinking you’ve held the flame of the lighter to their skin. 

Their brain doesn’t have enough input to compute between the hot and cold. Only when they open their eyes to see the ice cube, does the brain understand, “Oh it’s just ice. I’m not being burned.”

> More sensory input allows the brain to re-compute what it’s feeling, and, therefore,  relieve pain.[^21]


### But Why Are We Talking About Pain At All? Isn’t This Article About Balancing The Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous Systems Through Spinal Mobility?

Rogan et al noted, “In clinical and research settings in physiotherapy, the SNS is largely included in explanatory models for the development and chronification of pain. In osteopathy, for example, a model hypothesizes that disorders of the SNS can promote *and intensify* disease process. Especially the SNS can influence the trophicity (the nourishment of tissues) of various tissues as well as the blood circulation of the skin in the healthy and patients.”[^22]

An overactive SNS, perhaps in someone experiencing acute or chronic pain can cause an imbalance in muscle blood flow, can cause unnecessary muscle activation, and altered proprioception.[^23] Though this is significantly more common in those with chronic pain.

> Fun fact: the same goes for populations with chronic stress. Our SNS are similarly triggered by mental stress and physical, musculoskeletal, pain. [^24]

We have to at least briefly discuss pain because pain is a large part of SNS activation, and, therefore, throws off body homeostasis. 

### Exercise and Hypoalgesia

In “Exercise-Induced Hypoalgesia in Pain-Free and Chronic Pain Populations: State of the Art and Future Directions”, David Rice et al wrote, “In healthy, pain-free populations, a single bout of aerobic or resistance exercise typically leads to exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH), a generalized reduction in pain and pain sensitivity that occurs during exercise and for some time afterward. In contrast, EIH is more variable in chronic pain populations and is more frequently impaired; with pain and pain sensitivity decreasing, remaining unchanged or, in some cases, even increasing in response to exercise.”[^25]

It is normal for acute pain to trigger our sympathetic arousal. That’s that fight or flight response, essentially. 

Rice et al wrote, “In people with chronic widespread pain, lower parasympathetic activity rather than deregulated sympathetic tone is associated with great pain intensity, suggesting that intense pain is a chronic stressor interfering with parasympathetic activity.”[^26]

I’ve been talking about the SNS a lot, but the PNS is not to be forgotten here. 

Hallman and Lyskov wrote, “Studies have shown that parasympathetic withdrawal can facilitate sympathetic dominance of an ANS (autonomic nervous system) response and thus contribute to inadequate stress responses and cardiovascular adjustments during recovery following exercise of during sleep.”[^27] 

They continued, “It is known that conditions of psychological stress or pain can result in reduced parasympathetic (vagal) activity, a state that is associated with increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. For instance, reduced heart rate variability (HRV) reflected diminished parasympathetic (vagal) activity in workers who reported high levels of perceived stress and in people afflicted with chronic muscle pain.”[^28]

Okay, so the more can slow our heart rates the more our parasympathetic nervous system can be triggered. Makes sense. So, even though heart rate is regulated by both the SNS, and the PNS, the calmer we can make ourselves, the better our PNS will function. [^29] 

Therefore, it can be concluded that the great our heart rate variability, the better our parasympathetic tone.[^30]

Hence the deep diaphragmatic breathing techniquesI discussed to trigger the PNS.

But, can we trigger this through spinal mobility as well?

### Back To The Spine

So, how can spine mobility help to create body homeostasis between the PNS and the SNS?

Like anything else in the body, the nervous system can lose mobility. Physical Therapist, Joe Uhan wrote, The nervous system can lose mobility when any part of the spinal column become stiff…”[^31]

Can we better serve our body homeostasis by mobilizing the spine in specific ways, then?

Remember those Swiss physiotherapists we talked about earlier? In their review, they noted, “To date, only one pilot study on the possible effect of TSM [Thoracic Spine Movement] (T1-T5) on HRV [heart rate variability], BP [blood pressure], and HR [heart rate] as proxies for SPB [sympathetic/parasympathetic balance] has been published.”[^32]

Okay, I’m about to describe a scientific pilot study to you. It will be an overview, I’m leaving out some things for the sake of your and my sanity. If you’re interested in how they kept their tests as consistent as possible [go here](https://archivesphysiotherapy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40945-019-0067-2). 

(It is important to note, this pilot study had specific exclusions such as chronic pain, osteoporosis, blood pressure medication, fever, spinal fractures, among a few others. So really, it was looking at healthy adults exclusively.)

The conductors of the pilot study chose twelve healthy adults between the ages of 20 to 30 years old. The test subjects were split into two similar, but independent, groups. A “blinded statistician” performed the randomization and allocation of the participants.[^33] 

Group 1, Day 1: 
Scientists had their subjects lay in a prone position. 
Then rhythmically oscillated their subjects’ spines using posterior-anterior mobilization (PAM) at 120 movements per minute. This movement was performed for 100 seconds on every thoracic segment, from T6 to T12.[^34]

Group 2, Day 1:
Scientists had their subjects hold a sitting position. 
They then rhythmically oscillated their subjects’ spines using anterior-posterior mobilization (APM) at 120 movements per minute. This movement was performed for 100 seconds on every thoracic segment, from T6 to T12.[^35]

On  the second day, the groups were switched. Group 1 performed the movements of group 2. Group 2 performed the movement of group 1.

The results of the study were promising. “The results of the present pilot study suggest that TSM (T6 - T12) using PAM [posterior-anterior mobilization] but not APM [anterior-posterior mobilization] has the ability to induce SNS *and* PNS stimulation. The target parameters…changed significantly with large effect sizes after PAM.”[^36] (I added emphasis for effect.)

There’s more to be studied here. As mentioned, this is an overview, but there were some admitted inconsistencies in this study. Reminder: this was only a pilot study. 

However, this could mean that just by extending and flexing the thoracic spine in a prone position, we could be helping our autonomic nervous system find balance, and therefore, be helping to regulate our SNS and PNS responses. 

There might actually be something to spinal movement and better body homeostasis through SPB. 

## Conclusion

Body homeostasis is a key part to being a healthy human. The sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system play a large role in body homeostasis. The spine is an extremely mobile part of our body, and it also happens to be the main communication highway nervous system.

If we can stimulate our parasympathetic nervous system through deep belly breathing and calm thoughts and stimulate our sympathetic nervous system with long muscular holds, its seems like we should be able to help create balance through practicing more spine mobility.

Since pain triggers the SNS, many physiotherapists have used pain levels as a way of determining sympathetic/parasympathetic balance. Additionally, it has been proven that pain, and therefore the SNS, can be decreased through exercise and movement.[^37]

One pilot study proved that it may be possible to help create SPB through thoracic spine articulation from posterior to anterior extension and flexion, but more investigation needs to be done there.

I’m not saying that if you have a panic attack, you should lay face down and try to articulate through your T6 - T12 vertebra.[^38]

Much like we can floss—or stretch—specific nerves, we might be able to help create balance in our autonomic nervous system through mindful, purposeful, spinal mobility and manipulation. 

For now, breathe deeply, and, you know, move your spine around a little bit, just in case I’m right.
