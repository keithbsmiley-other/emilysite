> “She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself ‘Which way? Which way?’, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. To be sure, this is what generally happens when one eats cake; but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in a common way.”[^1]

## Now Are You Going to Talk About Meditation?

Nope.[^2]

More neurotransmitter stuff.

In part three I discussed my trials and tribulations with Wellbutrin. 

You may have even typed a little “well actually” note to me about how Wellbutrin isn’t an SSRI. 

I know. 

It was still relevant and set up the tone for parts 3 and 3.5. 

There’s a method to my madness. 

Today, we will actually talk about the type of antidepressant that Wellbutrin is. Today, we discuss NDRIs.

## Dopamine

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter. It plays a large role in how we feel pleasure. I’ve touched a bit on dopamine in a previous [article](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/pros-cons-instagram). It is essentially the key for reward-motivated behavior. Social media companies prey on the addictive nature of dopamine hits. As do casinos (see: slot machines).

But dopamine isn’t all bad. In fact, it’s not bad at all when it isn’t being used as a tool to turn us into screen zombies.

Dopamine, like most things naturally occurring in our body, is a good and necessary part of life.

Like serotonin, dopamine starts as an amino acid. The dopamine amino acid is tyrosine. 

Dopamine also has several functions in the body. They are:
1. Learning
2. Motivation
3. Heart Rate
4. Blood vessel function
5. Kidney function
6. Lactation
7. Sleep
8. Mood
9. Attention
10. Control of nausea and vomiting
11. Pain processing
12. Movement[^3]

## NDRIs

A different kind of antidepressant are NDRIs or norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. The only NDRI on the market right now is Wellbutrin (and its generic counterparts).

NDRIs act similarly to SSRIs in that NDRIs block the reabsorption of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine resulting in a greater number of active neurotransmitters available for use.[^4] 

### What Is Norepinephrine Again?

If you’ll remember, norepinephrine (NE) is primarily used by the sympathetic nervous system as a neurotransmitter. As a hormone, norepinephrine can play a role in your mood and ability to concentrate.[^5] While NE can help you focus, it also tends to increase anxiety.[^6]  

When I realized this, I couldn’t help but wonder: If NE increases anxiety, why the actual hell is it in anti-anxiety meds?

Acording to Dr. Eleni Dimaraki, M.D., MS, “Bursts of [NE]  can lead to euphoria (very happy) feelings, but are also linked to panic attacks, elevated blood pressure, and hyperactivity. Low levels can cause lethargy (lack of energy), lack of concentration, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (AHDH), and possibly depression.”[^7]

While NE can increase anxiety, it is meant to help you focus and “mobilize the brain and body for action” in a stress response.[^8]

Great in theory, didn't work for me personally in practice.

### Putting It Together

NE, epinephrine (adrenaline), and dopamine are also known as catecholamines, and, according to *Gateway Psychiatric Services*, “are all interrelated chemically”. They all “derive from phenylalanine and tyrosine.”[^9]

“These four neurotransmitters [Ne, dopamine, epinephrine, and serotonin] seem to be affected by most of the medications that are effective treating depression. This has led to what has been called the monoamine hypothesis of depression—which is the basis for the notion that depression is a disease or condition that reflects a lack of adequate amounts of brain chemicals”[^10]

Essentially, this theory refers to the hypothesis that depression is linked to a lack of these four neurotransmitters.

As you might have guessed (or I might have told you because I can’t remember anymore), antidepressants are classified by the neurotransmitters they affect. 

SSRIs are “selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors”.
NDRIs are “norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors”.
SNRIs are “serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors”.

There are more but you get the idea.

### Body Reliance

Let me just say there is absolutely no shame in taking antidepressants. The majority of the people I know have been on them for short and/or long periods of time. I have been on them. Life can suck. Our brains and guts might not be making enough of the chemicals we need to physically cope with a variety of struggles (like depression, anxiety, PTSD, or say, oh I dunno, a. global pandemic ).

If you have been on SSRIs or NDRIs and you want to come off of them, however, please, please refer to your doctor before you go cold turkey off of these medications. Your body will have withdrawal symptoms, and you absolutely need a medical doctor’s instructions and supervision to come off of these drugs. 

## Now Are You Going To Talk About Meditation?

I’ve been telling you all along that all this stuff in connected? So, technically, I’ve been talking about meditation this whole time. 

Just sayin’.

## Next Time On The Science of Meditation

I’ve been studying a lot about this, and realized I was missing a pretty key part of all of this: brain waves.

So, that’s what we’ll discuss next time.

Then, we’ll put it all together.
