If you haven’t read last week’s article, [The Science of Meditation: A Hypothesis on How and Why Meditating Can Help Depression and Anxiety (Part 1)](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/Science-of-Meditation), I highly suggest you do that first. 

While parts 1 and 2 are fairly self contained, the actual point of the five part series will make very little sense.

Read it? 

Great.

Let’s go.

## The Endocrine System

I have actively avoided discussing hormones in my blogs because they are just so incredibly complicated.[^2] I’ve going to do my best to explain what I’ve found. Please, if you know more about this than I do, feel free to reach out.

In order to discuss hormones, I feel we must talk briefly discuss the endocrine system at large.

This is a very complicated system of organs and glands. According to the Johns Hopkins blog, the endocrine system “uses hormones to control and coordinate your body’s metabolism, energy level, reproduction, growth and development, and response to injury, stress, and mood.”[^3]

Let’s break down the more major endocrine organs and glands. Shall we?

### Hypothalamus: 
- Located in the base of your brain near the optic chiasm[^4]
- A healthy hypothalamus secretes a handful of hormones that regulate other hormones released and suppress in the pituitary gland
- “…Controls water balance, sleep, temperature, appetite, and blood pressure”[^5] Think homeostasis and hormones when considering the hypothalamus.
- Think of the hypothalamus as the “command center” of the endocrine system. It communicates with the rest of the body through the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). It mostly “speaks” directly to the pituitary gland.[^6]

### Pineal Body:
- Located in the middle of the brain
- Produces melatonin—the hormone that tells our body it’s time to sleep[^7]

### Pituitary:
- Located below the brain
- Controls several function of other endocrine glands[^8]
- The pituitary gland has two lobes:
	1. Anterior Pituitary: The hypothalamus controls this glad by secreting releasing hormones. The anterior pituitary is responsible for the release of several different hormones that impact different areas of the body.
		a. Growth Hormone: Stimulates growth
		b. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone: plays a role in reproduction
		c.  Luteinizing Hormone: Essential for testosterone production and reproduction
		d. Adrenocorticotropic Hormone: Involved with the adrenal fear response
		e. Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone: Essential to metabolic responses
		f. Prolactin: Promotes milk production in lactating humans[^9]
		2. Posterior Pituitary: This lobe of the pituitary works slightly differently. While it does secrete two hormones, it does not synthesize (make) them like the anterior pituitary does. Instead, the hypothalamus synthesizes these two hormones. The hypothalamus then sends the hormones to the posterior pituitary for secretion. These hormones are:
			a. Oxytocin: Plays an important role in childbirth and lactation, but is thought to have important roles in social bonding and compassion. (See also Billie Eilish’s [banger](https://open.spotify.com/track/4t2OeILB07eMGTXSUbMPEu?si=54330b291edb4f78).)
			b. Vasopressin: Main function are to control urine output and regulate blood pressure.[^10] 
- The pituitary releases these hormones via the blood stream until they reach the appropriate organs.

### Thyroid and Parathyroid:
- Located in the front of the neck below the voice box
- The thyroid takes part of the body’s metabolism.
- The parathyroid glands take part in calcium balance.[^11]

### Thymus:
- Located in the upper chest
- Responsible for the production of white blood cells[^12]

### Adrenal Glands:
- Located on top of each kidney
- Works with hypothalamus and pituitary gland—like many other glands already mentioned
- Makes and releases “corticosteroid hormones and epinephrine that maintain blood pressure and regulate metabolism[^13]

### Pancreas:
- Located behind the stomach
- Helps with digestion and hormone production such as insulin and glucagon—helping to regulate blood sugar levels[^14]

### Ovaries:
- Located on either side of the uterus, below the fallopian tube opening
- Contains egg cells for reproduction
- Produces estrogen and progesterone[^15]

### Testis:
- “Located in a pouch that hangs suspended outside the male body”
- Produces testosterone and sperm[^16]

For the sake of this article, we’ll discuss mostly the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the adrenal glands, but some other organs and glands will be mentioned. Feel free to refer back to this section whenever you need for a quick refresher if you want.

Once your ANS is stimulated, in a sympathetic-associated state (fight, flight, etc) stress hormones are released from your adrenal glands.[^17]

Remember how I said the adrenal glands help maintain blood pressure and regulate metabolism? Yeah, that’s not all. 

The adrenal glands are also responsible for your response to stress.[^18]
There are two sections to the adrenal glands: the cortex and the medulla. Each section is “responsible for producing different hormones.”[^19]

I’m not going to discuss all of the hormones produced by the adrenal glands in this article. I may touch on others in other parts or other articles, but, for now, we are focusing on stress-related hormones.[^20]

## Stress-Related Hormones

### Cortisol

Here is where you might want to refer back to our little break down of the endocrine system. So, here’s a helpful [link](##header-hormones). 

In order for cortisol to be secreted, a series of events must occur. 

1. The hypothalamus produces corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). This then tells the pituitary gland to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This occurs on the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis.[^21]
2. ACTH tell the adrenal glands to make and release cortisol hormones into the blood.[^22]

(In a healthy body, the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland can both tell when there’s enough cortisol circulating. “If there is too much or too little cortisol, these glands respectively change the amount of CRH and ACTH that gets released. This is referred to as a negative feedback loop.”[^23])

To make things just a smidge more complicated, there are different zones to the adrenal cortex, and each one secretes a different hormone.[^24]  

Once the adrenal cortex is given the word from the pituitary gland, cortisol produced by the zona fasciculata (or the middle of the adrenal cortex).[^25] It is a glucocorticoid hormone. This means it is involved in the metabolism of carbs, proteins, and fats. Glucocorticoids in general are anti-inflammatory—which means cortisol is anti-inflammatory as well.[^26] Cortisol is also known to decrease bone formation.[^27] 

This is all well and good, but something for the sake of this article to note is that cortisol also controls our sleep and wake cycle, *and* can increase our blood sugar levels. 

So, for the purpose of this article our big take away is that:

> Cortisol “is released during times of stress to help your body get an energy boost and better handle an emergency situation”. [^28]

It is important to note here that cortisol is a secondary response to stress. In a stressful situation cortisol is triggered once a threat is perceived for a longer-term or ongoing period of time.[^29]

Acute stress, or short term stress, triggers the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine.[^30]

### Epinephrine and Norepinephrine

Epinephrine and norepinephrine, or adrenaline and noradrenaline respectively, are created in the adrenal medulla or the innermost part of the adrenal gland.[^31] 

The adrenal medulla is mostly responsible for these two key “fight or flight” chemicals.

Let’s make our way back up to the brain for a second though, because adrenaline and noradrenaline are triggered slightly differently than cortisol. 

According to the writers at Harvard Health Publishing, “When someone experiences a stressful event, the amygdala, an area of the brain that contributes to emotional processing, sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus.”[^32]

Let’s break this down into milliseconds.

Okay, say you see a ghost.

Before you can even process the concept of said ghost:

Your amygdala sends a signal to your hypothalamus that says, “There’s something scary.”

Your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary that says, “There’s something scary.”

Your pituitary sends a signal down your spinal cord and to your adrenal glands that says, “There’s something scary.”

Your adrenal medulla says, “Scary. Message received.” and creates adrenaline and noradrenaline. 

Your blood carries that adrenaline and noradrenaline through your body doing several different things to your physiology:

- Your heart beats faster, thus pushing blood to our major muscles, heart, and other main organs. This also means your pulse rate and blood pressure rise.
- You begin to breathe more rapidly. The small airways in your lungs open wide and relax to allow as much oxygen into your system as possible. All of this extra oxygen is sent to your brain to increase alertness.
- This increased alertness means your senses are heightened.
- The blood sugar and fats from temporary storage sites in your bodies are released and used as fuel.[^33]

AND THEN you physically say with your mouth hole, “Oh shit a ghost! I’m scared!”

That’s a lot to happen in such a short amount of time. 

> “All of these changes happen so quickly that people aren’t aware of them. In fact, the wiring is so efficient that the amygdala and hypothalamus start this cascade even before the brain’s visual center have had a chance to fully process what is happening. That’s why people are able to jump out of the path of an oncoming car even before they think about what they are doing.”[^34]

Okay.

So you have adrenal pumping through your veins. 

You have finally processed there’s a ghost.

And finally, finally(!) you scream with your physical mouths, “Oh shit a ghost! I’m scared!”

But the ghost doesn’t move. 

The ghost stays.[^35]

That first “shot” of adrenaline is starting to wear off, but you need more to keep you going. How can you fight or run away from a freaking a ghost without this hormonal super charger?!

That’s when “the hypothalamus activates the second component of the stress response system —known as the HPA axis. This network consists of the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the adrenal glands.”[^36]

The HPA *needs* another series of signals to keep that SNS pumping—to keep your energy “gas pedal” floored. You are, after all, fighting (or fleeing) a ghost.

If the brain still perceives danger, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Remember CRH? It’s the trigger for the series of events that lead to the release of cortisol. Cortisol, if you’ll remember, keeps the body “revved” and on high alert. 

This helps you stay for the fight against the ghost. 
Or helps you run as far away as possible from the ghost.[^37]

Only when the threat is gone, will the stress hormone levels begin to fall. 

### Chronic Stress

For many of us, the threat never seems to go away. That ghost stays there in the form of incessant work, emails, and slack channels; social media; constant news cycles; existential dread; climate change anxiety (this is a real thing); any anxiety really; or hell, it could be an actual poltergeist I don’t know your life.[^38] 

This chronic stress is, essentially, a foot constantly on the gas pedal of our autonomic nervous system. The HPA axis stays activated, “much like a motor that is idling too high for too long.”[^39] Eventually, things will begin to break down.

Continuous epinephrine surges are known to “damage blood vessels and arteries, increasing blood pressure and raising risk of heart attacks or strokes.”[^40]

Cortisol is a steroid.[^41] It helps refill depleted energy stores by increasing your appetite. However, if your stressor doesn’t require physical action, like running away or fighting, you’re not burning those extra calories. So you just gain weight. And, since fat is a massive source of energy, cortisol ensures that unused nutrients are stored as fat for future energy use.[^42]

All in all, chronic stress ain’t great.

## Relaxing “Hormones”

### Acetylcholine

When the parasympathetic nervous system kicks in, a hormone called acetylcholine is secreted. Acetylcholine slows the heart rate, which, if you’ll recall, is the first thing adrenaline increases during a sympathetic adrenal response.[^43] 

### Hormone vs. Neurotransmitter

Okay, here’s where shit gets a little crazy. We’ve been talking about hormones, which are transferred through the bloodstream, and neurotransmitters, which travel along that super cool information highway called the nervous system via neurons and neurotransmitters. 

> They are two different systems. There is a difference between the two.

Therefore, there is a difference between hormones and neurotransmitters.

But it can get a little blurry. 

According to Dale Purves and Stephen Mark Williams, authors of _Neuroscience, 2nd Edition_, “Neurotransmitters are chemical signals released from presynaptic nerve terminals into the synaptic cleft.”[^44] While hormones are secreted by the endocrine system, “Hormones typically influence target cells far removed from the hormone-secreting cell. This ‘action at a distance’ is achieved by the release of hormones into the bloodstream.”[^45]

To sum it up: 
- Neurotransmitters are the cars of the nervous system highway. They are the chemical messengers.
- Hormones are the end result of those messages and end up in the blood stream.

Here’s where the line is blurry:

Purves and Williams continue, “While the distinction between neurotransmitters and hormones is generally clear-cut, a substance can act as a neurotransmitter in one region of the brain while serving as a hormone elsewhere. For example, vasopressin and oxytocin, two peptide hormones that are released into the circulation from the posterior pituitary, also function as neurotransmitters at a number of central synapses. A number of other peptides also serve as both hormones and neurotransmitters.”[^46]

The complication:

> A chemical can act as both a neurotransmitter and a hormone. The differentiator is where in the body the chemical in being produced and is located. 

This made my research remarkably confusing at times.

One of those times was researching Acetylcholine.

### Yeah, You Really Didn’t Talk Much About Acetylcholine

You’re right, I didn’t. 

I wanted you to understand the difference between neurotransmitters and hormones a little bit better. 

Acetylcholine is one of the most abundant neurotransmitters in the body.[^47] A very large variety of nerves use acetylcholine to communicate.[^48]

Nerves use the chemical compound choline to create acetylcholine.[^49]

As previously mentioned, acetylcholine helps slow our heart rate. But it does way more. “Acetylcholine tells muscles to twitch and more, but it also tells your hippocampus to store a memory. It plays an essential role in alertness, attention, learning, and memory.”[^50]

>  “It’s so essential to memory, in fact, that acetylcholine deficits are associated with Alzheimer’s disease.”[^51]

But, for the purposes of this series, there’s really one thing I want you to understand about acetylcholine. It is a neurotransmitter used by the parasympathetic nervous system. It is *not necessarily* a hormone secreted when discussing the parasympathetic nervous system. 

Okay, remember how I mentioned that the parasympathetic nervous system runs a little differently from the sympathetic nervous system, and how I said we’d discuss it later? Welp, later is now. 

### Welcome to the future

According to Jacob Tindle and Prasanna Tadi, authors of _Neuroanatomy, Parasympathetic Nervous System_ , actions of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) include:

- In the male reproductive tract, it is parasympathetic stimulations that allows blood to fill the corpora cavernous and corpus spongiosum, causing an erection. “The PNS also give excitatory signals to the vas deferent, seminal vesicles, and prostate.” [^52]
- Parasympathetic stimulation in the eye causes the iris to constrict. “Additionally, it causes contraction of the ciliary muscle improving near vision.”[^53]
- “In the heart, parasympathetic stimulation…causes decreased heart rate and velocity of conduction through the AV node.”[^54]
- “In the vasculature, parasympathetic stimulation…leads to vasodilation.”[^55]
- “In the stomach and intestines, parasympathetic stimulation…leads to increased motility and relaxation of sphincters [as well as] increases gastric secretions to aid in digestion.”[^56]
- “In the gallbladder, parasympathetic stimulation…stimulates contraction to release bile.”[^57]
- “In the pancreas, parasympathetic stimulation…leads to the release of digestive enzymes and insulin.”[^58]
- “In the kidneys and bladder, parasympathetic stimulation…stimulates peristalsis of ureters, contraction of the detrusor muscle, and relaxation of the internal urethral sphincter aiding in the flow and excretion of urine.”[^59]

After being released, acetylcholine is inactivated or removed to allow new signals to pass through the synaptic cleft. In other areas, acetylcholine is removed enzymatically.[^60] 

That was a lot. I know. But I what you to think about where all of those organs are located. 

Stick with me.

[As previously mentioned](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/Science-of-Meditation), the PNS originates in the brain stem and the sacral spinal cord. While this may seem obvious, this means that many of the parasympathetic neurons leave the brainstem through the cranial nerves. 

Meaning, many of these PNS neurons bypass the spinal cord all together.[^61]

According to Tindle and Tadi, “Cranial nerves carrying parasympathetic functions include the oculomotor nerve (III) acting on the eyes, the facial nerve (VII) working on the lacrimal gland, the salivary glands, and the mucous membranes within the nasal cavity, the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) acting on the parotid gland, and the vagus nerve (X) acting on the viscera of the abdomen and thorax.”[^62]

(But Emily, what about the section of the PNS that originates at the sacral spinal cord? There is actually speculation in the medical field that the sacral spinal cord doesn't house the PNS at all. In fact, some argue it houses the SNS. So, I’m not going to dig deeper into it. It’s honestly not that relevant to what I’m getting at in this series anyway, and might just confuse you even more than you might already be.[^63] 

See? I don’t drag you down all the rabbit holes I’ve trudged through. Just the important ones.)

### The Vagus Nerve…That Sounds Familiar…

You can bet your bottom dollar it does. 

I’ve actually already discussed the vagus nerve in a previous [post](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/breathing). I’m sure you’ve read it several times by now, but just in case you haven’t I’ll do you a solid and re-explain. 

Each healthy human brain contains twelve nerves hard-wired to it. We are going to discuss Cranial Nerve X (ten) aka the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is the longest nerve in the body. It starts at the medulla oblongata runs down the throat, to the heart, to the intestines, and down to your, um, personal parts.[^64] 

(What I’m about to tell you  is totally off topic, but I will never stop thinking about it.[^65]The gonads start developing in the stomach of a human fetus near the diaphragm. This is where the blood and nerve supply are established. As the fetus develops, regardless of biological sex, the gonads descend to the pelvic region. As the gonads move downward, the Vagus Nerve is stretched in the same direction. If you didn’t know already, the male testes travel to the outside of the body. Incidentally, this is why biological males feel sick to the stomach when experiencing groin trauma. As written in the article “Off-Topic: Your Gonads Are Innervated by Your Cranial Nerves”, ”The nerves to your testicles come out of the same plexus that serves your stomach and most of your intestines, and the pain fibers go back the same way.”[^66])

According to Tindle and Tadi, “The vagus nerve is particularly influential within the PNS as it carries 75% of all parasympathetic fibers.”[^67]

So, remember how I mentioned what parasympathetic stimulation does to all those organs. And you read on and on.

 And you were like, “Emily, for the love of Zeus please be done with this list.”

And I was like, “That was a lot. I know. But I want you to think about where all of those organs are located. Stick with me.”

And you were like, “Ugh, fine. But there better be a point somewhere in this text book you’re writing. Jeeze, Louise.”

Welp, tada! Here’s my point.[^68] 

Your vagus nerve is responsible for *all of that list*. One huge freaking nerve that starts in the base of your beautiful brain is partially responsible for your heart working efficiently, your food digesting well, your erectile parts doing erectile things, etc.

And, if you’ll remember…

> The vagus nerve can be stimulated with your breath.

When we breath deeply into our diaphragm we are actually activating that nerve—therefore directly stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system.

Think of it like a massage for the PNS. With deep diaphragmatic breaths, we are triggering the PNS. Which in turn, tells our body to turn down the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS), and reduce the adrenal and cortisol levels in our bodies. Not only does stimulation of the PNS decrease cortisol and adrenaline levels, it increases endorphins to encourage even more relaxation, and less muscle tension.[^69] 

> When we practice deep belly breaths, we are telling the SNS that it’s not needed _right this minute_. 

Something else I’ve noticed about diaphragmatic breathing, I actually digest food more easily. This is caused by two things:
1. Psychologist Megan Riehl noted, “Diaphragmatic breathing massages the internal organs as the diaphragm moves up and down with each breath.”[^70]
2. Nutritionist Sarah Khan pointed out, “The vagus nerve stimulates and regulates digestive organs.”[^71]We stimulate the vagus nerve through diaphragmatic breathing thus stimulating our digestive system.

(You’re darn tootin’ right I copied and pasted that from my other post.)

[^68]:	I had a close friend in high school (as one does). Let’s call her Susan. 

	I also had an acquaintance in high school (as one does). Let’s call *her* Tiffany.

	I was telling Tiffany something one day in the car and *mid-sentence* Tiffany turns to Susan and says, “Wow, you were right. Everything is a story with her.”

	At the time, my feelings were very hurt. Not only was I interrupted, but I was interrupted to be complained about. And I was complained about to a friend who should have stood up for me, but was actually the person that complained about me to some rando in the first place.

	Seriously, what the fuck, Susan.

	Now, I wish I could time travel back into that car and say: *Your damn right everything is a story, Susan and Tiffany! What is life without context?!*

	(My friend’s name wasn’t Susan.)
	(My acquaintance’s name wasn’t Tiffany.)
