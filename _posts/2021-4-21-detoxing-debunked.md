Yeah, I know the title is a bit much. 

Alrighty, fam. Today’s the day. We’re going to talk about "detoxing". 

Detoxing gets thrown around a lot these days in both the nutrition and yoga circles. 

In theory, the concept of detoxing is amazing. Do thing X to get all the toxins out of your body. 

So amazing, in fact, I can’t help but wonder…

If we had to detox our bodies ourselves, wouldn’t the human race would’ve died out many, many years ago?[^1] 

Your body is literally *designed to eliminate toxins for you*. Why do you need to drink smoothies and do twists to release toxins when your liver, kidneys, skin, and lungs (to name a few) should already be filtering that shit out of you?

That’s kind of why peeing, pooping, and exhaling are things our bodies have to do. 

Before I get started please know, this article comes from a place of love and peace. Not hate and anger. Per usual, I’m just researching things, and explaining that research to you in a long-form manner. 

Also know, this is being written by someone who has done juice/smoothie/soup “cleanses”, and teaches yoga.

One last disclaimer: I’m not here to shit on your personal or religious beliefs. You live your best life. I’m simply giving you scientific facts based on scientific studies. If you cleanse every so often for whatever reason, and you feel healthy and good, keep doing you.

Lastly, just so you know where we’re headed on this journey of myth and mystery, I’m going to start off this article with Nutritional Detoxes (read: detox dieting). We will then proceed into physical movement to encourage detoxing (twists in yoga). Then, we’ll discuss the concept of sweating to detox. 

Here we go. 

## Detox Dieting

### The Liver

The liver has many jobs, most of which revolve around keeping bad stuff out of your body. It regulates chemical levels in the blood and excretes bile. That bile is what carries waste away from the liver. Every single blood cell that leaves the stomach and intestines goes into the liver.[^2] 

The liver then processes this blood. It breaks down, balances, and creates nutrients. It also metabolizes any drugs in the blood into nontoxic forms that the rest of the body can use or safely excrete.[^3] 

The liver is key to proper bodily function. Liver failure ends in death. Full stop. 

Think of your liver as a very necessary, built-in Brita Filter for your body. 

Your liver sits roughly beneath your diaphragm, and on top of your stomach, right kidney, and intestines.[^4] It is cone shaped, a dark, reddish-brown color, and weights about three pounds (in case you were wondering).[^5]

There are 500 vital functions of the liver.[^6] I could have tried to reword this list I found on the Johns Hopkins Medicine website, but I didn’t. This is 100% yoinked.

Here are a few:

1. “Production of bile
2. Production of certain proteins for blood plasma
3. Production of cholesterol and special proteins to help carry fats through the body
4. Conversion of excess glucose into glycogen for storage and to balance and make glucose as needed
5. Regulation of blood levels of amino acids
6. Processing hemoglobin for use of its iron content
7. Conversion of poisonous ammonia to urea
8. Clearing the blood of drugs and other poisonous substances
9. Regulating blood clotting
10. Resisting infections by making immune factors and removing bacteria from the bloodstream
11. Clearance of bilirubin, a form of red blood cells. (An accumulation of bilirubin turns the skin and eyes yellow.)”[^7]

Righto, now that you understand that…

### Toxins

Let’s talk toxins. 

Toxins typically enter our bodies in two forms
1. Endotoxins
2. Exotoxins

Endotoxins are toxins your body makes—they are literally made inside of you—such as feces, urea, and lactic acid (I did a whole IGTV thing on lactic acid. If you’re curious, [check it out](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CL5ibm7JdOy/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).

Exotoxins are toxins that you introduce into your body. So pretty much any chemical you put inside of or on your body. Think cleaning products, pesticides, cosmetics, pollutants, etc.[^8] 

### Our Internal Brita Filters™

The liver is made to detox our bodies of *both* endo- and exotoxins.[^9]

According to liver cancer specialist and surgeon Thomas Aloia, M.D., “Detoxifying the normal things we eat, breathe, and ingest is part of \[the liver’s] job and keeps us alive.”

So, we need to really take care of our internal Brita Filters™. 

Aloia continued, “The key is moderation. Don’t pack your liver full or fat, sugar, or alcohol, so the machine keeps doing its job well. It will handle all the things it needs to handle as long as it’s a healthy organ.”[^10]

How do we keep our livers healthy?

Over indulging in certain things will damage the liver over time.

Heather Alexander, author of _4 Detox Myths: Get the Facts_, on the University of Texas: MD Anderson Cancer Center website, noted, “Fried foods and sugary drinks are difficult for the liver to process, and too much of each of these things become fat in the liver.”[^11]

Alcohol can add more fat to your liver.

But Emily, I saw this ad for a liver cleanse on Instagram™ and it said it can help me lose weight *and* heal my liver. 

Okay, first off. Yes, cleanses and detox diets will probably help you lose weight, but not for the reasons you’re most likely thinking. 

There are two ways you lose weight on a detox diet or cleanse:
1. You lose water weight because you’re not taking in enough carbohydrates (which you will gain back post cleanse).
2. These diets are extremely calorie restrictive. So, yea, you got me there. Calories Burned \> Calories Ingested = Weight Loss. That’s Nutrition 101. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy weight loss. And, it certainly doesn’t mean the weight will stay off once you’ve started eating whole food again. Highly restrictive diets are notorious for increasing weight gain once they are no longer adhered to.

Secondly, these cleanses and detox diets are not regulated by the FDA, meaning proper trials and tests have not been conducted.[^12] There are limited studies that have shown a few ingredients in liver cleanses have *some* promise. Tinsay Woreta, M.D., a Johns Hopkins hepatologist noted, “Milk thistle has been shown to decrease liver inflammation, and turmeric extract has been shown to protect against liver injury.”[^13] 

Note how neither one of those said anything about *healing* the liver though?

Woreta continued, “Liver cleanses have not been proven to treat existing liver damage, but there are many other forms of treatment available for those who are affected.[^14]

Treatment options available for a few types of liver disease include (again this is 100% yoinked):
1. “Hepatitis A & B: Oral medications, and vaccines are available. 
2. Alcoholic Liver Disease: Stop drinking alcohol entirely. ‘The liver has an amazing ability to regenerate and heal once active injury has been stopped.’
3. Hepatitis C: Oral medications available.
4. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: The most effective treatment known to date is weight loss, which has been shown to decrease the amount of fat in the liver and the inflammation caused by the fat.”[^15]

I’m going to repeat this because it’s kind of a big deal. 

> *The liver will heal itself* if you just stop feeding it toxic materials like excessive fats, sugars, and alcohol.* 
Like accidentally ripping a lizard’s tail off over and over, if you just stop for a second you sick, sick bastard, that lizard will regrow its tail. 

> Overall, eating healthy whole foods is the best thing you can do for your liver. 

Which, seriously, is what almost every single one of my nutrition-based articles come back to.

Heather Alexander wrote, “If you switch to a healthy, plant-based diet of lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, you will likely get all the benefits detox products claim to offer, including inflammation reduction, improved digestion, more energy, and a boost to your immune system.”[^16]

So, a detox, such as a juice cleanse, isn’t actually going to “detox” your liver.  It won’t even heal your liver. 

But maybe you still like doing them. You might see it as a jump start to eating healthier. Great! I get it. Been there. Done that.

But, something to keep in mind: Not all cleanses are created equally.

Some are down right dangerous.

### Detox Danger

First thing to note. 

> Before detoxing became a fad it was a medical procedure. It was meant to rid the body of dangerous, life-threatening levels of alcohol, drugs or poisons.[^17] 

According to Harvard Medical School, “Patients undergoing medical detoxification are usually treated in hospitals or clinics. The treatment generally involved the use of drugs and other therapies in a combination that depends on the type and severity of the toxicity.”[^18]

Emeritus professor of complementary medicine at Exeter University, Edzard Ernst, said, there are two types of detox. One is the medical procedure mentioned above. “The other is the word being hijacked by entrepreneurs, quacks, and charlatans to sell a bogus treatment that allegedly detoxifies your body of toxins you’re supposed to have accumulated.”[^19]

So, there’s that.

Many cleanses that consist of nothing but juices, spices, maple syrup (I’m looking at you Master Cleanse), are actually very, very dangerous. Studies have shown low-calorie diets and fasts actually screw with your body’s basal metabolic rate. It can’t keep up with you because it’s too busy struggling to survive on a very limited amount of available energy.[^20] Not to mention cleanses like this seriously lack the necessary nutrients your body needs to survive. 

Laxative cleanses actually deplete the very necessary, and natural, flora (microorganisms) in your body that your digestive tract counts on to break down food.[^21] If you do cleanses such as these repeatedly, you actually risk disrupting your body’s acid-base balance, which could result in too much acid in your blood. This can lead to a coma, and/or death.[^22]

Some are just a scam entirely, Guardian contributor, Dara Mohammadi, noted, 

> “Other tactics are more insidious. Some colon-cleaning tablets contain a polymerizing agents that turns your feces into something like a plastic, so that when a massive rubbery poo snake slithers into your toilet you can stare back at it and feel vindicated in your purchase. Detoxing foot pads turn brown overnight with what manufacturers claim is toxic sludge drawn from your body. This sludge is nothing of the sort - a substance in the pads turns brown when it mixes with water from your sweat.”[^23]

And, as previously mentioned, if you’re still thinking cleanses and detox diets help you lose weight long-term, think again.

“Once the dieter resumes normal eating, rapid weight gain follows. Much of the weight loss achieved through this diet results from fluid loss related to extremely low carbohydrate intake and frequent bowel movements or diarrhea produced by salt water and laxative tea. When the dieter resumes normal fluid intake, this weight is quickly regained.”[^24]

### It’s Not All Bad

Stop yelling at me, Smoothie Drinker. First off, I like a good smoothie just as much as the next person. Secondly, read on.

Medical News Today reported, “According to the Office for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, three-quarters of people in the United States do not consume enough fruit and vegetables. Consuming drinks containing fruits and vegetables as part of a balanced diet may be a good way of helping a person get the nutrition they need.”[^25]

BUT, we need to define a few things. 

1. Juices: Juices are typically a combination of fluids from a variety of fruits and vegetables. While tasty, juices can actually greatly limit specific nutrients you’re getting from said fruits and veggies. Juicers deliberately eliminate all of the fiber from food. Fiber is essential to digestion, and gut health.[^26] Additionally, when made with specific fruits and vegetables (like beets and carrots) your blood sugar can spike tremendously (up to 40g of sugar in a 16 ounce serving).[^27] Since juice is the easiest thing to digest for the body (there are no solids to break down in juice), the spike can come hard and fast. 
2. Smoothies: Smoothies are typically a combination of blended fruits and vegetables. You can also add extra protein and healthy fat to smoothies to really boost the nutritional content. Smoothies can be a true meal replacement as they pack a rather large nutritional punch and can be quite filling. Because of this, they are higher in calories than juices. So, if you’re trying to lose weight, definitely use them as a meal replacement, and be sure to add fats and proteins 
(avocado, Greek yogurt, or protein powder for example) for a well-rounded meal.[^28]

### To Detox Or Not To Detox

One does not simply detox the liver with a mess ton of smoothies, soups, and/or juices. Liver detoxes have never been proven to help heal the human liver. 

> Semi-Relevant Fun Fact: Broccoli, sprouts, mustard plants, cabbages (all bassicas) contain cyanide. “Eating it provides a tiny bit of poison that primes the enzymes in your liver to deal better with any other poisons.” Drinking *within moderation, you animal,* (a few glasses of wine or beer a week), is proven to have a similar effect.[^29]

I’ll say it again for the people in the back. 

There is absolutely no scientific proof that detox diets help to heal your liver *or* remove toxins from your body.[^30] 

Edzard Ernst of Exeter University noted, “The healthy body has kidneys, a liver, skin, and even lungs that are detoxifying as we speak. There is no know way - certainly not through detox treatments - to make something that works perfectly well in a healthy body work better.”[^31]

However, the American diet is seriously lacking in fruit and veg. So, there’s no harm in blending up a nice smoothie for lunch rather than eating a meal you actually have to chew.

If you are still all about that detox life, please know they are not meant to be a long-term weight loss strategy (do not stay on them for more than a few days), and get the okay from your doctor first. 

Okay?

Okay.

## Twist Out The Toxins

I hate to admit that I used to buy into the whole “twists are detoxifying” myth. I thought, let Yoga take the wheel. Why wouldn’t I believe the things my teachers were telling me. So, since my teacher said it, I can say it when I teach my classes. This is how lies, innocent but lies never-the-less, get perpetuated and spread.  

I’m honestly not going to spend a ton of time on this because it feels extremely obvious to me, and, to be frank, I can’t prove a negative:

Hey, hey you guys. 

Your liver is not a dish cloth. 

> Your liver is not something that can be “wrung” out. 

Your liver is your liver, and it doesn’t actually twist in your body when you twist. As previously mentioned, that is not how the liver works. The liver functions on a very cellular level.[^32]

So no, you can’t twist away the bottle of Skinny Girl Margarita you had last night.

### Stop Yelling At Me, Yoga Teacher

Let me explain my snark.

The whole “your liver is like a dish rag” idea, probably came from B.K.S. Iyengar.[^33] He’s kind of a big deal in the yoga world.[^34]

Iyengar taught that twisting asanas (poses) created this “squeeze-and-soak” action in the spine and internal organs.[^35] 

Author of _Myth vs. Fact: How Yoga Helps Detox Your Body_, Jennifer Williams-Fields explained the “squeeze-and-soak” theory, “The organ would become compressed in a twist, squeezing out old blood and waste, and then once released, fresh oxygenated blood would flow in, creating healthier organs-much like a dirty wash cloth can take on fresh clean water after being wrung out of the old dirty water.”[^36]

This is what I was taught in my 200-hr teacher training. 

However, science has yet to back this theory up.[^37] 

Dr. Pam Peake, a Fellow of the American College of Sports Medicine noted, “Second by second, nanosecond by nanosecond, the human body is detoxing. It’s part of what it does, it never stops doing that. The squeeze and soak theory is very inaccurate and the assumption that we’re somehow beneficially increasing this detoxification process is not accurate, either.”[^38]

Twisting does increases circulation.[^39] It can also release tension from the muscles of the spine, abdomen and ribcage.[^40]

BUT, honestly, so does all physical activity. Peake continued, “All physical activity — not just yoga — increases the motility and mobility of the organs to perform their normal detoxifying functions.”[^41]

### Seriously, Stop Yelling At Me

I’m not saying yoga asana doesn’t have its perks. It is hugely beneficial to the body. Through yoga you can absolutely learn how to more efficiently calm, and [find balance within](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/breathing), the nervous system. You practice and learn balance and mobility all while challenging your proprioception. Yoga is hard. Yoga is good. Yoga is wise. 

AND, twisting in specific ways can help stimulate some of our internal organs—especially those responsible for elimination, such as the large and small intestines.[^42] I remember the first time I experienced this. After a massive twist I very suddenly had to use the restroom. In a very, very real way. In the middle of class. 

### Digestion and Twisting

[Deep breathing techniques](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/breathing), twisting, and stretching the abdominal organs can hugely impact how the bowels move. 

The intestines move digested food and liquid by a process called peristalsis. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases explained, “The large, hollow organs of your GI tract contain a layer of muscle that enables their walls to move. The movement pushes food and liquid through your GI tract and mixes the contents within each organ. The muscle behind the food contracts and squeezes the food forward, while the muscle in the front of the food relaxes to allow the food to move.”[^43] 

Ever watch a centipede or a millipede walk? That’s similar to how those muscles move -- kind of inch-worming digested food along your intestinal tract -- marching your literal shit towards your colon.

So, how can twisting help? It can (*notice how I said can*) help things literally move around, much like a gentle abdominal massage can encourage intestinal movement. 

For the most part, as stated by Kate Davidson, “Yoga may help relieve digestive issues by decreasing stress, increasing circulation, and promoting gut motility. However, scientists need to do more research to understand its role in specific digestive issues.”[^44]

> Fun Fact: Scientists and doctors are studying and prescribing yoga to their clients with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). However, the theory has very little to do with peristalsis. The thought is this: IBS may be caused by an over-active sympathetic nervous system (fight, flight, or physical challenge response), which draws essential blood and other necessary chemicals and fluids away from the digestive system to focus on fighting/fleeing/or fulfilling a physical challenge. Yoga, especially meditation and deep breathing exercises, have been proven to de-activate the sympathetic nervous system and activate the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest response), which, in turn, calms the digestion system and helps things return to a more normal state.[^45]

Keep in mind: I *teach* yoga for a living. I’m not trying to yuck your yum. 

I’m just saying, before you start throwing out random cues like “twist the toxins out of your body” consider what you’re telling your students and why you’re giving that cue in general.

## Okay, Fine. But At Least I Can Sweat Out The Toxins, Right? …RIGHT?!

I can not tell you how many times I had hung over students in my studio. And, yes, you can absolutely tell if they’re drunk or hungover because their sweat smells like the bottle of Jack into which they crawled the night prior.

But, before you head out to the sauna, hear me out.

### Sweating

You have two different kinds of sweat glands. 
1. Eccrine Glands: They are found throughout your body and are activated when body temperate rises, like in a hot yoga class. Kat Haegberg noted, “They secrete sweat that’s mainly made up of water and salt. And that’s what actually exiting your body when you work up a sweat in yoga -— water and salt. The purpose of eccrine glade sweat is to help regulate your body temperature, not unload toxins.”[^46]
2. Apocrine Glands: They are located in concentrated areas of the body (read: armpits and groin). Heagberg added, “They’re activated when we’re stressed, and secrete sweat that’s mainly comprised of water and fat (and tend to produce a noticeable oder once it comes in contact with the bacteria on your skin).[^47]

Sure, some other stuff gets in there as well. 

### Then Why Do I Smell Like A Brewery After A Night Out?

Amy Kraft of CBS News, and author of _Reality check: Does yoga release toxins from the body?_ wrote, “It is true that some toxins can dissolve in sweat, but only a trivial amount…” Dr. Pam Peake continued Kraft’s thought, “One percent of toxins at most get removed from the body through sweat.”[^48]

Dr. John Mayer, a clinical psychologist and substance abuse expert said, “The body treats alcohol like a toxin, but the liver can only metabolize about twelve ounces of beer an hour.[^49] Registered dietitian, and ACSM exercise physiologist Jim White explained, “The body gets rid of the rest through a process called oxidation, which breaks the toxins down into smaller parts called diacetic \[(or acetic)] acid, carbon dioxide, and water that the body can metabolize and excrete through urine, breathe, and sweat.”[^50] 

We sweat when we drink alcohol because, “drinking causes the blood vessels near the skin to enlarge, which causes people to feel flushed or hot and as a result triggers the body to sweat.”[^51]

Just because you sweat more, doesn’t mean you’re getting rid of the alcohol you put in your body. Jennifer Williams-Fields said it best, “You can’t sweat out a night of overindulgence of alcohol or fatty foods. Anything you ingest needs to go through the body’s system to be stored as nutrients, fat, or eliminated as waste.[^52]

This just means that, as Mayer explained, “You can’t sweat out the hangover, just the smell of the alcohol.”

(Think about it. Your body may start to sweat if you eat too much animal protein (the steak sweats are real). But you don’t start excreting steak from your pores.) 

Mayer continued, “In fact, if you sweat like crazy during hot yoga or a set of intervals...you’ll compound that dehydration problem, which may even worsen your hangover symptoms.”[^53]

But Emily, if we’re not sweating out toxic alcohol, why do I smell like a took a bath in a Jameson?

Jim White said, “The higher the alcohol content of the drink or drinks the person consumed the night before, the more alcohol oxidation a person’s body will go through, which means more stink-causing diacetic \[or acetic] acid.”[^54] 

> Fun fact: Drinking water is the only way to fight the smell. It helps your body dilute the alcohol and excrete the liquid more quickly, which will help kill the hangover smell.[^55]

All that being said, sweating is an extremely important part of [body homeostasis](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/spine-mobility-and-the-autonomic-nervous-system). It is required to help cool our body temperature’s down as the liquid on our skin evaporates. Moving vigorously in any way helps increase circulation, which has massive benefits to the body.

It’s also important to note, that while a key factor to body homeostasis, sweating too much can lead to serious dehydration. You have to drink water in order to maintain a healthy human body.

### So, No, You Can’t Sweat Out Toxins

Ingested toxins go through the stomach and liver and _then_ enter the blood stream. Once they’re in the blood stream, those toxins are coursing throughout your body. Sweating does not get rid of those toxins. 

> Puddles of sweat on your mat aren’t the aftermath of a mass exodus of toxins.[^56]

If you did go out on a bender the night before, you’re probably only sweating out about one percent ethanol (and other toxins). The rest is just water, and salt.[^57] And the smell? That’s a byproduct of your body oxidizing the alcohol that’s already in your system.

But Emily, I feel so much better after I’ve sweat it out. Explain _that_. 

That’s not the sweat, my dude. It’s the endorphins.[^58] Sorry.

Then what’s all the hullabaloo about sweating out a fever?

I don’t really see how that’s relevant to this specifically, but I’ll bite. 

A fever is defined as an increase in your body’s temperature. As mentioned before, sweat occurs naturally in this instance. 

There is absolutely no scientific evidence that sweating will get rid of a fever or even help you feel better.[^59] 

Fever is typically a sign of infection. And, similar to sweating out alcohol (I guess?), you can’t sweat out infections.[^60]  

This is a huge assumption, but my guess is the concept of sweating out a fever actually came from humoral medicine created way back when Hippocrates was a calf, and then was expounded upon during the Renaissance. If this piques your interest, [read this](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/humoral-medicine).

## So, I Can’t Detox At All. Thanks For Ruining My Plans For This Weekend.

Alright well hold on there, friend. 

I’d like to think I didn’t ruin anything for you. Instead, I enlightened how you *can* actually detox. 

By which I mean eat healthy, whole foods.[^61] 

You cannot heal most of the damage done to your liver, but you can stop damaging your liver; thus, giving it time to heal itself. Stop drinking alcohol, or minimize your alcohol intake. Reduce your fatty food intake to a healthier amount. Drink more water. You know, all the basic things I’ve been writing about since I started this blog. 

No, twisting does not wring out your liver like a dish rag. But, it does increase circulation. It can help digestion, and aide in spinal mobility.

And no, you can’t sweat out your hangover. You have to live with your mistakes. But, you can drink more water to help the process along. 

All of that being said, I will concede to this. Ancient medicine, specifically ancient eastern medicine, seems to know way more about the body than we westerners give it credit for. Sometimes, it feels like science is just now catching up. (See also: My paragraph about IBS patients being prescribed yoga, my article about [diaphragmatic breathing](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/breathing), and some of the modern promises of [Ayurvedic technologies](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/humoral-medicine).) 

Therefore, just because science doesn’t show it now, doesn’t mean it won’t show it later. Science, like all knowledge, is ever evolving. And if the time comes when scientists say the Master Cleanse is a well-vetted, well-studied stroke of genius, and I do an article on that, and then you say “See Emily! See! You just flip-flopped so hard! Why did you flip flop?!” 

I’ll just quote Leslie Knope.

> “Well, because I learned new information. When I was four I thought that chocolate milk came from brown cows, and then I flip-flopped when I found out that there was something called chocolate syrup.”[^62]

For now, take solace in the fact that you’re body is an amazing machine with it’s own detoxing system. Sure, you can drink a healthy smoothie for lunch to get more vegetables. But toxins don’t come out of your feet at night because you have your special socks on. Pooping more just means you’re eating more fiber, not that you’re scraping the extra poop that's shoved in the dark, mysterious corners of your colon. 

You can twist during yoga class to help increase circulation and spinal mobility. But you’re not wringing out your internal organs like a dish rag. And you’re not flushing out your organs by holding blood back then allowing it all to rush in. 

And lastly, you can sweat all day long (it’s actually good for your skin as long as you shower all the salt off quickly afterward) -- you might even feel better for a while after a work out because endorphins are a thing -- but, realistically, that hangover headache will still be there until you get some water and electrolytes in your blood stream. 

We’re are always looking for short cuts, ways to enhance our bodies, and/or ways to make up for the bad things we put in our bodies. 

Unfortunately, there are no short cuts. 

Your body is a pretty amazing machine as is — no enhancement necessary.

If you're otherwise healthy, and you don't feel great, maybe stop putting bad things in your body for a while, and let your body heal itself.[^63]
