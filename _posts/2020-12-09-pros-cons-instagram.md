Back in July a friend/student emailed me to see if I was interested in teaching her private yoga classes.(fn) I, of course, was interested. Not only had I not been teaching due to COVID layoffs at my old yoga studio, but I missed my unapologetically eclectic community of fitness and yoga San Franciscans(fn). 

My friend and I started chatting about what everyone in our community had been up to since the layoffs in March. Turns out, a large handful of them moved away from San Francisco. COVID-19 careened towards us, and we all scattered like ants from a boot. But, I had missed all of these massive life changes in my friends’ lives. I had no idea so much change was happening. 

Why did I have no idea?

I deleted my instagram account many months before hand. I cut myself off entirely from social media. “They’ll text me updates,” I told myself. “I see most of my friends on a daily basis anyway at work. It’ll be fine.” Well, no one texted me updates.  I did see my friends at work, until there was no more work. 

I was in a social black hole, if I’m being honest. Radio silence with the exception of two or three people. I don’t blame them. Social media is how communication works now.

I felt badly that I had missed so much. So, I rejoined Instagram. I started posting stories, and following my friends. I reconnected with damn near everybody. The sentence: “I missed you!” was exchanged multiple times. And I did miss them. I missed them all. But that’s what made me even sadder, honestly. COVID aside, social media has become a place to interact with other humans without actually having to interact with other humans. 

The longer I’ve been on Instagram though, the more and more I repeatedly see two things that have really irk me: 
1. The perpetuation of a certain, almost entirely unobtainable body image, which can lead to very real body image issues.(fn)
2. In the fitness community, specifically, misinformation that can lead to serious bodily harm.

So, today I’d like to discuss something possibly controversial for someone who depends on (fitness + yoga) Instagram for her business. Today, let’s talk about the effects Instagram can have on a person, and how to cultivate a body positive, physically safe, Instagram feed.

### Social Reward and Dopamine

I’d like to start off by saying two things.
1. I’m writing this during quarantine in the era of COVID-19, which means we, as a society, are desperate for human interaction. Most of us can’t even see our loved ones, let alone hug them. At the start of this article, I admitted to losing connection with most of my friends entirely, because I was no longer on social media. I understand the irony, and I will offer a solution, that works for me, to the COVID conundrum later on.(fn)
	Even though this article will point out some glaring issues with social media, Instagram specifically, I’m not at all trying to say Instagram/social media in general, is evil and should be shut down. It has it’s place among us. “On one hand, social media use may be beneficial as it allows greater connectedness with others, leading to an increased sense of well-being.”(fn) It allows us to stay connected with our loved ones, and find connections around the world that we otherwise wouldn’t have access to. It has its perks, without a doubt.
2. I do try to use Instagram to drive people to my website, for online classes and this blog. Though, a lot of times I feel like I’m screaming into a void filled with everyone else’s voice, leaving us all deaf and just a little dumber. I hope my knowledge and experience helps other people realize what advice to use and what not to use on Instagram and other social media platforms.

Okay, now that that’s out of the way. Let’s talk about dopamine.

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter. It is “one of those chemicals that is responsible for transmitting signals between the nerve cells (neurons) of the brain.”(fn) Some of these cells are located in the ventral regimental area (VTA).(fn) “One of the best-described roles for VTA dopamine neurons is in learning about rewards.”(fn) Let’s take a quick second to define “rewards” in this context. 

Rewards here are when something good happens unexpectedly. For example:

Say you put a quarter into a slot machine, and pull the lever.

The machine buzzes, dings, and spits out five quarters. Dopamine hits.

Well, shit! How about that! What else will this machine give you?

So, you put another quarter in. You pull the lever. Nothing happens.

Well it worked before, and it felt really good when it did (thanks, Dopamine). Pull it again. Just to see.

Another quarter. Another pull. You receive two quarters for your efforts. 

Dopamine.

Another quarter. Another pull. Nothing.

Another quarter. Another pull. Nothing.

Another quarter. Another pull. Nothing.

Another quarter. Another pull. Nothing.

Another quarter. Another pull. Nothing.

Another quarter. Another pull. Nothing.

Another quarter. Another pull. Nothing.

Another quarter. Another pull. Nothing.

Another quarter. Another pull. Two more quarters. 

Dopamine.

Well, now you’re down on quarters, but it sure does feel good when the machine buzzzes and dings, and gives you a little money back. 

So you pull it again, and again, and again. That’s a dopamine-driven feedback loop.

That’s also gambling addiction. 

In fact, most addictive drugs induce the release of dopamine.

It did not take long for the people at Facebook, Twitter, etc to realize that you can get a dopamine-driven feedback loop from your social media feeds as well. It’s manipulation and exploitation of human brain chemistry. Tristan Harris, former design ethicist at Google said, “Social media isn’t just a tool waiting to be used. It has it’s own goals, and it has it’s own means of perusing them by using your psychology against you.”(fn)

Shirley Cramer CBE, Chief Exectutive, RSPH, said, 
> “Social media has been described as more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol, and is now so entrenched in the lives of young people that it is no longer possible to ignore it when talking about young people’s mental health issues.”(fn)
 
So, that is forever something to keep in mind when dealing with social media. They are exploiting your psychology for cash. That is how they make money.

I’m hoping this article will help you learn how to play the game to better use this system in your favor, rather than turning into a drone who constantly pulls down to refresh a digital page on a little piece of glass. 

###Body Image, Anxiety, and Depression

In early 2017, Britain’s Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) and the Young Health Movement (YHM) conducted a survey “examining the positive and negative effects of social media on young people’s health, including a league table of social media platforms—YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat  and Instagram— according to their impact on young people’s mental health”.(fn) (Sure, this study is a few years old, but you get my point.(fn)) Those surveyed were asked to “score how each social media platform they use impacts upon 14 health and wellbeing-related issues which were identified by experts as the most significant”.(fn)

The list included:
1. Awareness and understanding of other people’s health experiences
2. Access to expert health information you know you can trust
3. Emotional support
4. Anxiety
5. Depression
6. Loneliness
7. Sleep
8. Self-expression
9. Self-identity
10. Body mage
11. Real world relationships
12. Community building
13. Bullying
14. FOMO (fear of missing out)(fn)

Guess which scored the most negative. Go ahead. I’ll wait.

That’s right! Instagram! (fn)

Instagram revolves around taking the ideal photograph or video of yourself. Video editing, filters, etc can set unrealistic expectations and create feelings of inadequacy.(fn) I’m not even getting into the tips behind posing in specific positions or the use of lighting techniques to make it seem like these people have no cellulite, belly fat, acne, etc.(fn) 

There’s the rub. These photos psychologically force people to compare themselves the others on these sites.(fn) “Various studies have documented widespread body and weight dissatisfaction among girls and women, and social media has been found to be a significant catalyst for the appearance concerns.”(fn) In fact, “cross-sectional data have been revealed that for both women and men, Facebook use is associated with greater (upward) social comparison and self-objectification, which are both related to lower self-esteem, poorer mental health, and body image concerns”.(fn)

> In an article posted on Psychology Today’s blog, Ravi Chandra M.D., D.F.A.P.A. states, “Facebook and Instagram are correlated with dissatisfaction with body image (through social comparison), orthorexia (restrictive dietary habits, especially influenced by Instagram), idealization of thinness and other problems with body image, and substance abuse.”(fn)

When you look at fitness Instagram, specifically, you’ll find very skinny, mostly white, women doing workouts that are either extremely difficult, highly sexualized (for some reason), and/or completely inaccessible to realistic body types. 

>“Social media present innumerable idealized images of thin, lean/tone, beautiful photo-shopped women, and the “thin ideal” and “athletic ideal” are displayed as a normal, desirable, and attainable body type for every women. Furthermore, the Internet and social media have been found to promote thinness, dieting behavior, and weight loss through idealized images of ‘perfect’ women. Women who use social media often internalize the ‘thin ideal,’ causing them to strive for an unrealized, unnatural standard of beauty and to feel ashamed when they are unable to achieve it.”(fn) 

This creates a spiral of low self-esteem and anxiety that can lead to eating disorders and severe depression. It can be extremely toxic, especially to younger minds.

###Fitness, Nutrition, and Yoga Misinformation

Fitness Instagram is a massive industry now. The hashtag “fitspo” has a whopping 72.1 million posts. And sure, inspirationally speaking, Instagram can have a place in helping others strive to live healthier lifestyles.

In fact, Instagram has become a way for people to educate and inform themselves about health and fitness. More than 40% of users noted that information they’ve found in social media alters the way they approach their health. (fn)

Sounds great right? People are learning how to become healthier through connections with others. In theory, it sounds amazing, and yet...

The problem is users can’t discern correct information from incorrect, and sometimes dangerous, information.

>”Nutritionists are concerned with the fact that so much dietary advice shared on social media is conflicting. This can...make people...adopt dietary plans that are overly restrictive and otherwise unhealthy.”(fn)

Most of the influencers on these social media sites aren’t qualified to make claims about nutrition or fitness. Much like social media itself, a lot of influencers aren’t trying to help others, they’re trying to make cash on your views/likes/comments. That’s literally their job—to drive followers and likes to their posts in order to receive money and goods from businesses. 

I’m not saying all influencers are evil. I’m not even saying all influencers are giving the wrong information. What I am saying is this: When it comes to the fitness, and nutrition industry, be smart about who you follow and why you follow them. Following the wrong information could seriously hurt you. 

Seriously. 

Like, no joke. 

Fact check everything, especially when it comes to things like nutrition through calorie restrictions, and physical therapy tips for current injuries.(fn)

###How To Use Instagram To Your Advantage

Lucky for us, we can fight the system, and still use it to our advantage. 

First off, limit your social media usage: This is just a good rule of thumb in general. [Apple makes this very easy.]

Second, curate your feed intelligently. I’m sure you’ve heard something about algorithms in relation to social media. What’s a social media algorithm? “Social media algorithms are a way of sorting posts in a users’ feed based on relevancy instead of publish time...But under the hood, algorithms involve machine learning and data science. They’re capable of parsing data and ranking posts based on criteria that, quite honestly, the average marketer will probably never truly understand.”(fn) However, sometimes, companies are transparent about what will help content rank higher and been seen as “high-quality”.(fn)

Instagram clarified a few points about their algorithm back in 2019:
>”What shows up first in your feed is determined by what posts and accounts you engage with the most, as well as other contributing factors such as the timeliness of posts, how often you use Instagram, how many people you follow, etc.”(fn)

And there it is. The secret to curating your feed. Instagram will show more things like what you’ve already engaged with. Remember, their entire business plan is to keep you glued to your phone. So, for example, if you like a photo of a plant. Instagram will push more plants your way.

If you spend time on a post published by a certified yoga teacher, an actual nutritionist, a certified personal trainer, or a physical therapist, you’ll see more of those, too.

If you see a post that doesn’t make you feel good, or makes you second guess your positive self image, or feeling happy, don’t pay them any mind. Don’t comment. Don’t like the post. Don’t interact with it anymore. Move on. That will let Instagram know, “Hey, they don’t like those kinds of posts. Let’s not show those to her anymore.” And they won’t. 

On social media happiness feeds happiness as much as misery feeds misery. Approach your timeline as you might approach anything else you do with your mental and physical health— with intention, intelligence, and mindfulness. 

You can bend Instagram’s algorithm to your favor, you just have to be smart about it.


###Conclusion

Humans are social creatures. Even I, a self-proclaimed super-duper introvert, need social interaction every once in a while. It’s been scientifically proven that, “being socially connected to others can ease stress, anxiety, and depression, boost self-worth, provide comfort and joy, prevent loneliness, and even add years to your life.”(fn) Conversly, lack of strong social connections can be a real threat to your mental and emotional health.(fn) 

Social media, especially during the era of COVID-19, can be a great way to stay connected with friends and family, and serve as a much-needed outlet for self expression.

However, social media can be a toxic place that decreases self-image and body positivity, and increases anxiety, depression, and, other mental disorders. It can also cause bodily harm if you follow the advice of someone unqualified.

The good news is you can use Instagram’s algorithm to benefit you. Create the feed that you want to see. 

Use social media as a tool to serve you, rather than the other way around.
