I have written three different beginnings to this blog. None of them worked for me. So, I’m cutting the bullshit. I’m killing my darlings. Cutting straight to the chase.[^1]

Today, we’re discussing what makes up connective tissue, what connective tissue is, and, the least studied (yet arguably just as important), connective tissue in our bodies: fascia. 

> Get excited.

## Connective Tissue

Let’s talk about connective tissues.

There are many different functions of connective tissues in your body. And, they, um, well, connect stuff together. 

Shocker.

Think connecting tissues to organs. Bits of bone to bits of bone. Bones to bones. Muscles to bones. Cartilage. Even blood is considered a connective tissue.[^2] 

According to “Anatomy & Physiology”, a chapter in an online textbook provided by Lumen Learning and Rice University, “connective tissue cells are dispersed in a matrix. The matrix usually includes a large amount of extracellular material produced by the connective tissue cells that are embedded within it.”[^3] Many studies refer to this matrix as the Extracellular Matrix or ECM. 

> Christian Frantz et al explain the ECM as, essentially, the scaffolding of connective tissue.[^4] 

There are typically two components that make up this matrix:
1. Ground substance — It is “usually a fluid (water), but it can also be mineralized and solid, as in bones.”[^5]
2. Protein Fibers — We’ll get to this in a second. 

Okay, let’s zoom out from the ECM for a second. 

As you probably noticed by my list of what could be considered “connective tissue”, the stuff comes in many shapes, sizes, and varieties. Despite their differences, they are all made of up three characteristic components:
1. Ground substance
2. Cells
3. Protein fibers[^6]

> Each connective tissue will have different amounts of each component depending on the function of the tissue, i.e. the ground substance in bone will be more rigid than skin or tendons.[^7]

### Those Elusive Cells: Fibroblasts

Okay, I recently learned about fibroblasts, and they kind of really blew my mind—hence the title of this article. 

There are a few different kinds of cells found in connective tissue, but fibroblasts are by far the most common—probably because they are extremely important. 

In their article, “Fibroblasts and Myofibroblasts in Wound Healing: Force Generation and Measurement”, authors Bin Li and James H-C. Wang write, fibroblasts are “responsible for tissue homeostasis under normal physiological conditions.”[^8] They help to maintain the structure of connective tissues.

How? Great question.

Fibroblasts secrete proteins and polysaccharides.[^9] These proteins and polysaccharides “combine with other fluids to produce a viscous ground substance that, with embedded fibrous proteins, form the ECM.”[^10] 

### A Side Note: Fibroblasts and Healing

There are three stages in healing.
1. Inflammation
2. Proliferation
3. Remodeling[^11]

The first thing that will probably happen when you cut yourself is blood pooling at the area. That’s just a symptom of being alive. The heart beats. Blood happens.

In a healthy body, the blood then starts to clot (a blood clot is essentially a thickened mass of blood tissue formed by platelets and fibrin (a protein).[^12]

This is when the inflammation stage starts to take place. 

The blood clots dry forming a scab. Once scabbed over, the body’s immune system kicks in. The wound will be tender and swollen. It may even become more red. According to Dr. Debra G. Wechter, this is because “blood vessels open in the area”, bringing oxygen and nutrients to the wound.[^13]

Okay, here’s where it gets cool re: fibroblasts (though fibroblasts technically take part in all three stages of healing).[^14] 

Proliferation follows the inflammation stage after 2-5 days.[^15] This is where contraction takes place. According to Li and Wang, “contraction is an important part of wound healing, as it enables wound closure.”[^16] (While contraction is extremely important — as it is the phase that literally leads to wound closure—too much contraction causes undesirable formations resulting in scarring, leading to both cosmetic and functional problems.[^17])

> Underneath that scab, your fibroblasts are laying down new extra-cellular matrix components—leading to wound contraction and remodeling of the wounded area.[^18] 

As you might guess, this all gets way more complicated, but this is a very general over view of how fibroblasts aid in healing and the regeneration of the ECM. There are a lot of studies floating around out there that look into how engineering fibroblasts and ECM production could help decrease, or eradicate, scarring in wounds. 

### What Else Do Fibroblasts Do?

So, I mentioned something about fibroblasts secreting proteins, yes? 

Yes. 

I did. 

Technically, it secretes fibers, but those fibers are made of protein links. So, you know, semantics and what not.

Those proteins/fibers are very specific, and you’ll probably recognize at least one of them.

1. Elastic fiber: created by elastin proteins
2. Collagen fiber: created by collagen proteins
3. Reticular: also created by collagen proteins [^19]

Each of these fibers have different necessary properties. 

Elastic fiber, for example, and as you might have guessed, is stretchy and easily comes back to its original shape. Elastin is found mostly in skin and “the elastic ligaments of the vertebral column.”[^20] 

Reticular fibers are pretty much everywhere, but “are most abundant in the reticular tissue of soft organs such as [the] liver and spleen, where they anchor and provide structural support to the parenchyma (the functional cells, blood vessels, and nerves of the organ)”.[^21]

Collagen fibers, like elastic fibers, are flexible. Unlike elastic fibers, however, collagen fibers have “great tensile strength, resist stretching, and give ligaments and tendons their characteristic resilience and strength. These fibers hold connective tissues together, even during the movement of the body.”[^22]

## Collagen

Okay, let’s stop here for a second. There’s a lot more to cover, but I really want to discus collagen because I see collagen supplements freaking everywhere.

Here’s the thing, I know that taking vitamins and minerals when your diet doesn’t contain enough of said vitamins and minerals is good for you. I get it. Take your vitamins. I take a daily vitamins and minerals every day. 

You do you.

But when I see something that’s practically advertised as a “miracle cure”—especially anything related to aging—I immediately assume it’s bullshit, and let my research prove me wrong.

So, let’s get into this.

Collagen is found in a lot of places throughout the body, namely skin, bones, and joints.[^23] You know in the connective tissue.

Collagen, as previously mentioned, is a protein. It makes up nearly 33% of all proteins in the body. Brad Dieter (yeah, I can’t believe that’s his real name either), author of 0Do Collagen Supplements work? Here’s What The Science Say”, writes, “Collagen is formed in the human body by ‘assembling’ collagen fibrils from three amino acids: proline, glycine, and hydroxyproline. These fibrils are then bundled in larger groups, much like muscle tissue, to make collagen fibers. As such, collagen has a cable-like structure in that it is comprised of many smaller bundles of proteins that are bundled together, which gives it much of its physical properties including great tensile strength.”[^24] 

I know I said that already, but how cool is it that collagen is structured similarly to muscle tissue? 

Pretty freaking cool.

### Collagen Supplements

As we age, our collagen production decreases. Gabriela Ulloa writer for the *New York Times* and author of “Are There Benefits To Collagen Supplements?” interviewed Dermatologist Dr. Whitney Bowe to find out more. Ulloa writes, “Dr. Whitney Bowe described our body’s collagen as ‘ropes of protein in the skin.’ When we’re young, the rope remains tight, but as we age, the ends begin to fray. Essentially, our bodies are not able to replace the collagen we are losing as quickly as it is breaking down.

> “Starting in our 20s, we begin losing about 1 percent of our collagen each year, said Dr. Bowe. This, unfortunately, means drier skin. Sun exposure, cigarette smoke, and pollution can also accelerate collagen breakdown.”[^25]

Here’s the catch though, research has not proven that collagen supplements are absorbed into the blood stream. Even hydrolyzed collagen (a supplement that is supposed to be more easily absorbed by the body) isn’t proven to be absorbed.[^26]

The other thing that’s up for debate is whether or not the amino acids make it to their target organs.[^27] 

Pretend I’m Ms. Frizzle for a second, and jump in this proverbial Magic School Bus with me. 

Okay, you take a collagen supplement. Let’s say it was a powder. 

Collagen is a bundle of amino acids. 

The body treats that supplement like every other thing you put in it. It breaks that food down to a molecular level. 

You can’t force your body to use those amino acids to recreate the collagen you ingested and then put it in the skin underneath your eyes.[^28]

You’re in the Magic School Bus, remember? You’re just along for the ride. Can’t force the body to do anything. Unfortunate, I know.

As for collagen creams, well osmosis doesn’t really work. “Dr. Bowe explained that is because collagen is produced in the deeper level of the skin, called the dermis (which is lower than the epidermis), it is very hard for topical collagen to actually make it there.”[^29]

Collagen supplements are said to have all kinds of positive effects on skin health, cellulite reduction, bone strength, arthritis, digestive health, heart health, muscle mass, and mental health.[^30] But the research proving any of these benefits just isn’t there yet. The studies conducted have been small and inconclusive.[^31]

I’m not trying to yuck your yum. If you take collagen supplements, and you think they’re working for you, that is awesome.  There are very few risks of taking it other than it being somewhat pricey and the potentially bad taste.

Honestly, it seems like the biggest risks are if you have food allergies. A lot of collagen is made of animal protein (my more allergy prone readers keep an eye out for shell fish) so make sure you read the label.

> Ulloa of the *New York Times* also mentioned, “Watch out for products marketed as ‘plant-based collagen’. They don’t actually contain collagen, and though they say they support collagen production, the science is not there to back it up.”[^32]

## Now That I’ve Ruined Collagen Supplements, Let’s Move On

There was one type of connective tissue that I intentionally didn’t mention before now: Fascia.

In my yoga trainings, they explain fascia like the casing around muscle. The term “sausage casing” was thrown about far too often for my liking, but hey, it gets the point across quickly and efficiently.

Fun fact: If you get a cut of meat fresh from the butcher and it still has that thin fibrous layer over the meat that you have to pull of before cooking, that’s the fascia. 

Eat your protein, everyone!

Anywho, fascia is way more than just the connective tissue around muscles though. 

Historically, very little has actually been studied about fascia in Western medicine. It was mostly just the stuff in the way of the muscles during dissections. It’s almost like everything in the body has a purpose.[^33]

(Side note: I’ve been sitting on this section for a full 24 hours because there’s just so much I could potentially cover here. I’m going to try to stay on point.)

Fascia, like all connective tissue, is primarily made of collagen fibers/proteins, elastic fibers/elastin proteins, and ground substance (water). In fact, [when magnified 25x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgNoUrNlgr4) you can literally see the water moving throughout well-hydrated fascia. 

You guys, hey, you guys, really think about this: When you magnify fascia you can literally *see the water traveling throughout the substance*.[^34]

> Water carries nutrients. Ipso facto: Fascia helps to carry hydrating and nutritional substances throughout the body.

Pft. Just a sausage casing my lily white butt.

I promised I’d stay on point like 3 paragraphs ago, didn’t I? Oopsers.

Okay, There are four classifications of fascia.
1. Superficial 
2. Deep
3. Viseral
4. Parietal[^35]

### Superficial Fascia 

According to Adrianna Gatt et al, authors of “Anatomy, Fascia Layers”, “Superficial fascia is found directly under the skin and superficial adipose [fat] layers.” In that video of fascia magnified (which was superficial fascia, BTW) that I talked about earlier (and will keep talking about until the end of my time), the narrator, Ronelle Wood, notes that superficial fascia is thicker in the main “trunks” and becomes thinner as new “branches” form on the periphery with sustained traction.[^36] 

Gatt et al second that point. They add that “superficial fascia layers can sometimes include muscle fibers to create all types of structure in the body. A few examples include the platysma muscle in the neck, the external anal sphincter, and the dartos fascia in the scrotum.”[^37] 

Didn’t poop your pants today? Thanks facia![^38]

### Deep Fascia

This form of fascia surrounds tissues deeper in the body, i.e. bones, nerves, blood vessels, etc.[^39] Gatt et al explain, “Deep fascia tends to be highly vascularized and contain well developed lymphatic channels.”[^40]

(In case you didn’t know, the lymphatic system is part of your immune system. It helps to protect you body from illness, maintain homeostasis, absorb fats, and remove cellular waste.[^41] 

Didn’t get sick today? Thanks fascia![^42]

Deep fascia has two subtypes.

1. Aponeurotic fascia: The stuff that covers muscles needing a wide area of attachment. It can also “thin into a tendon and become a point of origin of insertion of other muscles.” It is the thicker of the two subtypes and is easier to separate from the muscle.[^43]
2. Epimysial Fascia: This is the stuff that covers the skeleton muscles (pectorals major, trapezius, deltoid, and gluteus maximus), and can connect directly to bone. It is the thinner of the two subtypes and is harder to separate from the muscle.[^44]


### Visceral Fascia

This fascia covers your organs that live in cavities such as the “abdomen, lung[s] (pleura), and heart (pericardium).”[^45]

Are your lungs able to inflate and deflate without friction? Thanks fascia![^46]

### Parietal Fascia

Gatt et al explain, “parietal fascia is a general term for tissues that line the wall of a body cavity just outside of the parietal layer of serosa.”[^47] 

(Don’t worry, I didn’t know what “serosa” was either. I looked it up. “Serosa: A membrane that lines an internal cavity to protect the contents and secretes serum.”[^48] The intestines have serosa. As does the uterus (it’s called the perimetrium if you know uterus part names *shrug*.))[^49]

Parietal fascia, in the simplest of terms, protects and brings nutrients to the protection around some internal cavities. 

Intestines snug, secure, and frictionless? Thanks fascia![^50]

### Yep, I’m Still Talking About Fascia

My point in explaining all of this is to drive home the fact that fascia isn’t just the stuff in the way of the muscles. It’s freaking everywhere. 

And it’s for something that was just tossed into the trash on dissection tables, it does a lot of heavy lifting.

> “Fascia may appear passive structurally but are, in fact, active. They can provide support for surrounding tissues, help reduce friction, and play a supportive role for the tissues and organs. Fascia can transmit mechanical tension generated by muscular activity or external forces.”[^51]

But wait, there’s more!

According to Hopkins Medicine, “Fascia has nerves that make it almost as sensitive as skin.”[^52] 

Can we pause on that for just a quick second. There are nerves in fascia. Nerves. 

Nerves. 

Freaking nerves.

If you’re not in fitness or medicine, this may not seem insane to you, but it’s insane to me. 

The ramifications of fascia having nerves is pretty mind blowing considering what most yoga teachers and personal trainers are taught—which is the nervous system talks to muscles (almost exclusively) to code things like proprioception into our brains.

> “Sensory nerves innervate the fascial tissue. The deep fascia, specifically, is extensively innervated with multiple sensory nerve subtypes. This includes, but is not limited to, nociceptors, proprioceptors, mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, and chemoreceptors.”[^53]

In her video, Ronelle Wood says, “These are fiber optics that conduct consciousness throughout your body sharing information about proprioception. It’s a beautiful thing.”[^54]

You’re damn right, Ronelle. 

Something else Wood mentions that is worth noting because it’s my segue to the next part of this post: “The vascular system is buried in the fat and fascia. When the fascia clamps in in the ‘dear God we’re going to die’ response [the sympathetic nervous system], the purpose is to inhibit and squeeze these blood vessels so that if you get cut you don’t bleed too much. It squeezes your nerves so that if you get hurt you don’t feel it right away.”[^55]

(I would also argue, just knowing what I know about the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, that the squeezing of the blood vessels during a stress response could also be to ensure more blood goes to the parts of the body that need to be fully functioning—like certain muscles, the heart, and other vital organs.[^56] And, the squeezing of nerves in a stress response is to keep you running away or fighting that ferocious tiger without worry about the cut on your leg.[^57])

So, when you are stressed, or in an [“fight or flight”](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/breathing) state, your fascia tightens.[^58] 

I would also like to add that your fascia tightens up when you’re in one place for a long time, like hunched over a computer screen or asleep for example. 

> “When fascia is dry or tight around muscles, it can limit mobility and cause painful knots to develop.”[^59]

Fascia, like the rest of our body, should be well hydrated, as well as stretched and moved regularly.[^60]

There are several different ways to help do these things: 
1. Drink water
2. Do yoga (I’ll get to what type, and why yoga specifically later.)
3. Foam roll aka: Myofascial Release
4. Message Therapy
5. Acupuncture (I’ll get to this is a second, too.)[^61]

### Anatomy Trains

Let’s pull back for a hot minute. Fascia is all over your body, right? Right. 

The only thing that actually separates muscles groups is fascia. 

Sausage casing, remember? 

So if our fascia is constantly touching other fascia, that must mean that everything in our body is connected through fascia.  

No, I didn’t smoke anything this morning. 

Hear me out. 

This guy Tom Myers is pioneering this concept. He calls these connections “Anatomy Trains”. [^62]

He explains, “I developed the Anatomy Trains during the 1990’s, as a game for students to play when I was teaching Fascial Anatomy at the Rolf Institute. But when I came to try to teach, all the books you can find put forward the ‘single-muscle’ theory. I began stringing the muscles together through the fascia. The ‘rules’ are that the connections have to follow the grain the fascial fabric in more or less a straight line, without breaks or changing levels.”[^63]

Essentially, Anatomy Trains is a map containing twelves myofascial meridians. Meyers refers to them as “strings of sausages that I call the myofascial meridians.”[^64] 

There are twelve meridians. My descriptions of them won’t do the pictures justice. Look them up.

1. Superficial Frontline: connects top of your toes all the way to the back of your head
2. Superficial Backline: connects underside of toes to your eyebrows
3. Lateral Line: connects back of foot to the top of your neck
4. Spiral Line: connects occipital ridge (nape of neck) to your IT Band and TFL (outside of your legs)
5. Superficial Front Arm Line: connects your wrist (Carpal Tunnel) to your Lats
6. Deep Front Arm Line: connects your thumb muscles to your Clavipectoral fascia (the connection of you pec and your collarbone)
7. Superficial Back Arm Line: connects the top of your hand to your traps
8. Deep Back Arm Line: connects the muscles in your palm that control the little finger to those two ropes muscles in the back sides of your neck (Levator Scapulae)
9. Front Functional Line: connects the lower edge of your Pectoralis major and Adductor Longus (inside of your thighs)
10. Deep Front Line: connects your toe flexors to your jaw muscles
11. Back Functional Line: connects your lats to the side of the top of your lower leg bone (the side of the lower knee)
12. Ipsilateral Functional Line: connects your lats to middle of the top of your lower leg bone (the top of the lower knee)

How did Myers discover these meridians? Through dissection. 

Myers explains:

“Well,” says Myers, “we went into the lab. We did the dissections. We’ve done the dissections many times on all the lines, and every one of the lines can be taken out as a fascial unity. 

“There are people who say, ‘No you’re just carving the lines. You can carve anything out of a human.’

“Well, maybe. But we are doing a discipline. We are following the fascial fabric, and it has to be going it the same direction. In other words,  there has to be a line of pull. We’re taking about a line of tension as we were earlier with the tensegrity idea. We’re talking about a line of tension. The more you pull on it the straighter it gets. That’s the way tension works. So, you ought to be able to see the fibers or find or dissect the fibers that connect one sausage to the next sausage — and we have — and I believe that that’s fairly well demonstrated.”[^65]

Myers goes on to explain that during the dissections, they find the tension on the fascia by separating the fascia from the muscle/organs/tissues.[^66]

Like I said, these descriptions of Myers’ myofascial meridians do not do the maps justice, as you can’t *see* how they wrap around the body. Look them up. Or just believe me when I say, it’s buck wild in the coolest possible way.

Why is this so potentially groundbreaking?

Because it means relaxing your jaw can help relieve pain in the bottom of your foot. 

That’s absolutely bonkers. 

Alternatively, it means that if you have something like plantar fasciitis, it could present with pain in your lower back. 

If you’re interested in this at all, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T60vzafspaY). Let Tom Myers explain it to you himself.

## Acupuncture, Yoga, and Fascia

Remember how I mentioned ways to help relieve fascial pain? Yoga and acupuncture? Remember how I said I was going to talk about these things later? 

Well, later is now. 

Welcome to the future.

Western medicine is just now starting to discover the important functions of fascia. 

Psst, in case you didn’t know, Western medicine is balls deep in colonialism. It’s a long story, just take my word on it. Let me take you over Eastern medicine for a second. 

### Acupuncture

“Acupuncture is the practice of penetrating the skin with thin, solid, metallic needles which are then activated through gentle and specific movements of the practitioner’s hand or with electrical stimulation.”[^67]

Acupuncture has been a part of traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years.[^68] “Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners believe the human body has more than 2,000 acupuncture points connected by pathways or meridians. These pathways create an energy flow (Qi, pronounced ‘Chee’) through the body that is responsible for overall health.”[^69]

Well, gee golly whiz, ya’ll. 

I do recall I said something about how fascia contains nutrient-rich ground substance (water)—ground substance you can literally see when fascia is magnified. It’s almost like traditional Chinese medicine knew about fascia way before Western science did. 

Like thousands of years before.

Yu Bai et al authors of “Review of Evidence Suggesting That the Fascia Network Could Be the Anatomical Basis for Acupoint and Meridians in the Human Body” explain that according to traditional Chinese medicine, the body contains meridians (different from Tom Myers’ Anatomy Train meridians, but not entirely separate)— or “strings of acupoints, which may be visualized as passageways through which energy flows throughout the body.”[^70]

Guess how many principle meridians are in traditional Chinese medicine? 

Go on. 

Guess.

Yeah, 12. 

12 freaking meridians. 

Just as Myers found.

Unlike Myers’ meridians, however, in traditional Chinese medicine, each meridian “connects to an organ system and extends to an extremity, and eight collateral.[^71]

Sure, it wasn’t scientifically tested. But hot damn, there’s got to be a reason this shit is still practiced today, no?

It seems so coincidental, that acupuncture, once dismissed by Western medicine, is starting to be studied again, with fascia in mind. 

> Gianluca Bianco, author of “Fascial neuromodulation: an emerging concept linking acupuncture, fasciology, osteopathy, and neuroscience”, “According to Traditional Chinese Medicine ‘acupuncture is believed to restore the balance between Yin and Yang’ and this can be understood in the Western medicine terminology as a ‘modulation of the equilibrium between parasympathetic and sympathetic activity.’…It has been recently proposed that mechanical signaling through the connective tissue, along with transmission of the matrix deformation through the fascial system network, can explain the therapeutic effect of acupuncture. This model of acupuncture, which involves the transduction of mechanical signals through the connective planes and produces a secondary involvement of neurophysiological mechanism, appears to fit very closely to the ancient model. It is also compatible with the proposed neurophysiological explanation. Furthermore, it appears to be fruitful also in manual therapy approaches. [^72]

TL;DR: Acupuncture works; and, it works through the fascial network. 

### Yin Yoga + Restorative Yoga

I’m pulling out Yin yoga and Restorative yoga specifically for a few reasons. 

1. Power Vinyasa, Bikram Yoga, etc are all more muscle-based. Bikram (Hot) yoga and a lot of power vinyasa studios encourage taking class in high temperatures. This will not only warm up your muscles faster, but it will also warm up your fascia. When warm, fascia is gooey and more pliable. It’s actually better to practice Yin yoga or Restorative yoga  at room temperature, specifically when you first wake up. 
2. Yin Yoga is actually based on Taoist principles from ancient Chinese philosophy. Yin Yoga specializes in slowing down—practicing a bit of peace to all the yang energy of our busy lives. Fascially speaking though, Yin yoga is extremely beneficial.
3. Restorative Yoga is not the same as Yin yoga. Restorative yoga is meant to make you comfortable in uncomfortable situations. Yin yoga is meant to make you uncomfortable and to learn to breath through that discomfort. They both have their place. 

Let’s think back to what we’ve learned in this article. 

Fibroblasts secrete collagen, elastin, and ground substance.[^73] These are the building blocks of all connective tissue.

Fibroblasts also help to create the extracellular matrix—the scaffolding of our connective tissues. 

Connective tissues are, essentially, soft tissue—everything from bone to skin to fascia. 

Fascia contains nerves, nutrients, and parts of our vascular system. Fascia is active. It tightens when we are stressed. It is almost as sensitive as skin.

Fascia is made up mostly of collagen (connective tissue, remember). Collagen is more sturdy than elastin, but pliable. It has the ability to be reshaped; remodeled. And, it contains the fibroblasts to help this restructuring. 

If fascia is warm and gooey, not much reshaping can be done. Have you every tried to reshape Vaseline™? It doesn’t work. 

If fascia is cold—like when you just wake up—it will be tight. It will be hard to move your muscles. But, it will also tell those fibroblasts what needs to be restructured. Through tension we can recreate the tightness of our fascia. 

So, while Yin yoga and Restorative yoga might just look like you’re laying in weird positions, you’re actually telling your fibroblasts, your fascia, your body, “Hey, when I twist like this, I’m tight in this part of my body, but I’m loose over here. Can we do something about that?” 

And your body, your fascia, your fibroblasts are like, “Sure, let’s try to work that out.” 

Those 2-10 minute holds give the body the time it needs to recognize the issue and begin the restructuring process. 

I know I don’t have a lot of footnotes here, because there’s not a lot of Western science-related research on this, but it just makes sense, doesn’t it? Based on the knowledge we now have, doesn’t this make sense?

(Now, in Yin and Restorative yoga not only are you helping your fascia and muscle release and restructure, but you’re forcing your sympathetic nervous system to learn how to control itself. Yin yoga isn’t comfortable or easy, but it teaches you to breathe through discomfort in a safe, predictable way. Something we could all use.)

If you don’t want to do Yin or Restorative yoga, do some myofascial release on a foam roller. Same principle, different technique. Or go get a fascial massage.

## Conclusion

I feel like I just did that, so…I don’t know man, I’m not a fascia scientist. 

The body is an amazing thing. Do some yoga or roll out your fascia. Say “Hi!” to you favorite fibroblast for me.

I’ll let Tom Myers take us out:

“Fascia draws together all the branches of medicine. And I think we’re going to be discovering a lot more about it in the next 40 years. It’s not that facia is more important than anything else. It’s just we haven’t paid much attention to it. So we need to pay some attention to it now just to catch it up to the other places.”[^74]
