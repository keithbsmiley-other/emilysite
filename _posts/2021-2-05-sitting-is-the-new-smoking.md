People in the fitness world go on and on and on about how bad sitting is for you. I’m guilty of this too. 

“Americans sit too much,” they say. “We work all day sitting down. It’s bad for us.”

My response to this: Eeeehhhhh, not exactly, maybe. In fact, we may be demonizing sitting for all the wrong reasons.

A few weeks ago, I heard a story on *Fresh Air* about how this paleoanthropologist, Daniel Lieberman, who also happens to be a professor in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard, conducted studies on isolated villages in both Africa and Latin America that have not been industrialized. “He studied how much time indigenous people there sit, sleep, walk, forage, dance, and run. He’s compared their activities, their bodies, their health and longevity to that of Americans.”[^1]

Color me intrigued. I couldn’t listen to the entire episode due to being sidetracked by life and family and things. However, I did find it later. 

Hold on to your butts.[^2] 

**Exercise is not a natural human behavior**

After Terry Gross did her Terry Gross thing, Lieberman opens with an important distinction between physical activity (doing the dishes, cleaning, walking to the bathroom) and exercise (a voluntary action for the sake of our health and fitness). Due to COVID however, people are doing *less* physical activity. No long walks down the work corridor all the way to the bathroom. No walk and talk meetings. No going to grab lunch three blocks away from the office. So, we found ourselves in a movement deficit.[^3] (Hence the reason no one could find stationary bikes and free weights during the start of the pandemic.)

> TL;DR: All exercise is physical activity, but not all physical activity is exercise.

“It’s just that we’ve created a world in which we don’t have to do much work anymore, right?” asks Lieberman. “We don’t have to be very physically active. And so today, people do something very strange, which is they— you know, they go on a treadmill. Or they, you know, go for a five-mile run in the morning for the sake of just the five-mile run…that’s exercise. And that’s a very modern behavior. People never did that before because until recently, people had to be much more physically active every day in order to get food, or sometimes, to avoid being somebody else’s food.”[^4]

The act of exercise itself is a modern phenomenon. Moving for the sake of movement is not a natural human behavior. 

(…um, I was going to put this next tid bit as a foot note, but it’s too good to potentially get overlooked by all you slackers who don’t read my, sometimes, amazing footnotes.

> Did you know: The modern treadmill was invented in the Victorian era to torture prisoners. Oscar Wilde was “condemned to…trudge on a treadmill for, like, five, six hours a day to prevent him from enjoying himself.”[^5] 

Treadmills were literally used as torture devices. 

This just proves my point: Running is literally torture.[^6] )

Anyhoo, pre-industrial humans had to carry heavy things, and walk places, and do a plethora of other everyday physical activities to survive. Even then, a lot of people didn’t have the appropriate calorie intake. So extra movement for the sake of movement is bonkers to pre-industrial humans. You’re wasting precious energy. That’s like telling a tiger to go for a 5-mile run without putting a zebra at the other end. It makes no sense evolutionarily speaking.[^7] 

This is because our bodies are extremely energy-intensive. The human body is energetically expensive. It takes a lot of energy just to survive.

> “The average sedentary American is still more active than the typical wild chimpanzee…” [^8]

Because of all of this, humans evolved to expend energy “when it was necessary or rewarding.”[^9]

Before you start screaming about the unhealthiness of the modern American diet, and high sugar intake, I get it. We eat more high-calorie, less nutrient-rich foods.[^10] And because our modern foods have high calorie content we *need* to work out to burn the excess stored energy and stay healthy. I get your point. But, that’s not *my* point. 

My point here is that the need to exercise is pretty insane evolutionarily speaking. In a world where movement could actually led to starvation, why on Earth would you move more for funsies? You wouldn’t.

So, if we didn’t evolve to exercise, what else didn’t we evolve to do?

Answer: Sit in a chairs for long periods of time.

**Interrupted Sitting**

Okay, so get this, a few of Lieberman’s colleagues put an accelerometer on a some of the aforementioned hunter-gatherers. Turns out, the indigenous hunter-gathers sat for about ten hours a day. Which is about how much we would typically sit at any desk job.[^11]

> It’s not weird, or even unnatural, to sit a lot.

“So,” Lieberman says, “if you look at how much time people spend sitting at work, it’s not really that associated with heart disease or cancers or diabetes. But if you look at how much people sit when they’re not at work, well, then the numbers get a little bit scary.”[^12]

The problem is what you do for the rest of the day. 

Math time:
If you sit for 10 hours a day and sleep for 8.  That’s 18 hours a day of no physical activity. That leaves 6 hours for physical activity. 

Notice how I said physical activity and not exercise? You can prevent inflammation, and possibly even joint dysfunction, just by moving. If you find that you’ve been sitting for a longer than 20-30 minutes: get up.[^13] Go pet your dog. Go to the bathroom. Grab some water. Whatever you wanna do. I’m not here to yuck your yum. Live your life. Just get up every once in a while. _Cue the singing angels_ This is what we call: Interrupted Sitting.

Okay, now, let’s talk posture.

**Get Off Your Throne, and Squat On The Floor With Us Plebes**

If you look at the history of chairs—and now I can say I have (I do these things so you don’t have to)—you’ll see that chairs were actually tightly attached to social hierarchy throughout history. Zooming in on the Middle Ages, you’ll see that the more money you had the more likely you were to have a proper place to put your derrière.[^14] And when I say a “proper place”, I mean a chair with a back on it. A throne, if you will. Others less fortunate than the pope or king, sat on benches, stools, or, *gasp*, the floor. 

Several cultures, especially those in Asian countries, gravitated toward squatting or sitting on the floor. It wasn’t just for leisure either, many of these cultures took to cooking, cleaning, working, and relaxing in a seated or squatting position.

Several studies have found that these positions, those dictated by crouching, squatting, sitting on the floor, or even sitting in a non-backed chair, are significantly better for your back—and general posture—than chairs with backs. 

Why?

The same reason why you should move every thirty minutes or so: to use your muscles. 

Backed chairs (this goes for couches too) allow most of your muscles to turn off. Do you know what happens when your muscles are turned off for a long period of time? They wastes away. Quite literally: If you don’t use it, you lose it. 

Now, I’m not saying your ass is going to fall off because you sit for long periods of time. What I am saying is this: It is scientifically proven that our muscles get weak when we don’t use them. They atrophy. I’m not even going to put a foot note here, because that *feels* like common knowledge. 

So, why do we have bad posture? Our chairs allow us to turn off the muscles we should be working to maintain *good* posture. Backed chairs stop the need to sit upright on our own accord, allowing our core muscles to weaken. Backed chairs keep our hips tight, and lack of movement keeps our knees inflamed. Backed chairs rob us of burning extra calories—those rat bastards. 

In a study similar to Lieberman’s, scientists proved that hunter-gatherer’s in Tanzania, the Hadza, had three times the levels of physical activity than advised by the U.S. federal health guidelines, but they sat just as much as sedentary Americans (just like Lieberman found).[^15] The way they sat, kneeling and squatting, required a constant light level of activity—more muscles were turned on at rest. Light levels of activity means more calorie burn. It means stronger core muscles. It means healthier humans, and less chronic illnesses that typically are correlated with sitting in developed cultures.[^16] I’m looking at you heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.

## Conclude This Please, Emily

The takeway: Be cognizant of what you’re putting your body through on a day to day basis. Be cognizant of how long you’ve been sitting. And for the love of all that’s holy: Move! Even if it’s just a little bit. I’ll bet you a burrito there’s dishes in your sink right now that could be cleaned.[^17] Your butt and your sink will thank you. Win-Win.
