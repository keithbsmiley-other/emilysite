# Micro-dosing Death: Carbon Balancing, Weight Loss, & Anxiety Reduction through Efficient Breathing & Breath Retention

I know I’ve said this before, but I really mean it this time.

This one’s a doozy.

So, in the wise words of Samual L. Jackson, “Hold on to your butts.”[^1]

I was chatting about breath with a friend/mentor the other day. We were talking about how breath is cyclical. You breathe in. You breathe out. You breathe in again. You breathe out again. Over and over, forever.

She pointed out that it’s easier to hold your breath on an inhale rather than on an exhale. 

In a way, she noted, exhaling all the air out of the lungs and forcing your body to hold that moment in your body is like micro-dosing death. Well, the writer in me couldn’t *not* use that as my title. So, I did.[^2]

## Breathing

Why is it easier to hold an inhale?

The body has oxygen to work with on an inhale. 

On an exhale, your body has nothing to work with. On an exhale you’re on a ticking clock. 

*Aquatics International* author, John R. Fletemeyer, writes, “A high concentration of carbon dioxide combined with a low concentration of oxygen in the blood triggers the need to take a breath…”[^3] If we do not breathe in oxygen and release carbon dioxide in a timely manner, we will lose consciousness. Once the airway is clear again, our body breathes naturally, and, eventually, we wake up. 

But let me take a step back. 

### The Lungs

Okay, so there is this thing called Boyle’s Law. It states that in an enclosed space, pressure and volume are inversely related.[^4] If pressure increases volume decreases. If volume increases, pressure decreases. 

What does this mean for our lungs? 

According to an online textbook produced by *Lumen Learning*, a for-profit company helping educational institutions use open educational resources, “The thoracic cavity, or chest cavity, always has a slight, negative pressure which aids in keeping the airways of the lungs open. During the process of inhalation, the lung volume expands as a result of the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles (the muscles that are connected to the rib cage), thus expanding the thoracic cavity. Due to this increase in volume, the pressure is decreased, based on the principles of Boyle’s Law.”[^5]

*How Your Lungs Work* on the *British Lung Foundation* website notes, “Signals from the respiratory centre in your brain travel down nerves to your diaphragm and other muscles. The diaphragm is pulled flat, pushing out the lower ribcage and abdomen. At the same time, the muscles between your ribs pull your rib cage up and out. This expands the chest and draws air into the lungs.”[^6] 

The lungs are fairly elastic, which means the lungs are designed to bounce back to a neutral, not full, state. “The elastic recoil within the tissues of the lungs exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs. These outward and inward forces compete to inflate and deflate the lungs with every breath.”[^7] 

The lungs draw back to force air out. The intercostal muscles are allowed to relax, returning the chest wall to its natural position. The diaphragm relaxes as well, and recedes to its natural position higher into the chest cavity. “This increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity relative to the environment. Air rushes out of the lungs due to the pressure gradient between the thoracic cavity and the atmosphere.”[^8]

Exhaling is a fairly passive process as the muscles around the lungs relax, and the lungs themselves contract to an emptier state, returning the chest cavity to a negative pressure to allow for the next inhale.

So that’s how the respiratory system works, but how does the oxygen get into our blood stream?

### The Blood

Inside the lungs are little air sacs called alveoli.[^9] These alveoli have very thin walls. Oxygen moves across those walls into tiny blood vessel called capillaries.[^10] Hemoglobin (a protein) in the red blood cells carries the oxygen to your heart and throughout your body. Carbon dioxide in the blood then passes across the alveoli walls and into the alveoli to be breathed out.[^11]

Fun Fact: “Blood with fresh oxygen is carried from your lungs to the left side of your heart, which pumps blood around your body through the arteries. Blood without oxygen returns through the veins to the right side of your heart. From there it is pumped to your lungs so that you can breathe out the carbon dioxide and breathe in more oxygen.”[^12]

So, there’s a balance of O2 (Oxygen) and CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) within our bodies at all times. 

## Blood

Okay, so carbon dioxide is exhaled. We know this. But how does it get *in* the body in the first place. 

According to Shivani Patel et al, authors of *Physiology, Carbon Dioxide Retention*, “Carbon dioxide is formed intracellularly as a byproduct of metabolism…CO2 plays various roles in the human body including regulation of blood pH, respiratory drive, and affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. Fluctuating in CO2 levels are highly regulated and can cause disturbances in the human body if normal levels are not maintained.”[^13] 

So, yes, technically CO2 is a toxin, *but* it has other key roles within the body, specifically within the blood stream. CO2 is actually a huge part of [body homeostasis](http://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/spine-mobility-and-the-autonomic-nervous-system), and it is just as important as oxygen.

Let’s zoom in a little bit on how carbon dioxide functions with oxygen and hemoglobin. 

Once CO2 is in the blood, it reacts with the water in the blood stream. That reaction creates bicarbonate and hydrogen ions.[^14] As more carbon dioxide enters the blood stream, more hydrogen ions are produce, and the blood pH decreases. This decrease in pH actually forces oxygen to dissociate from hemoglobin molecules.[^15]

So, the body actually requires more oxygen to reach the same O2/hemoglobin saturation as when the blood pH was higher. Which actually explains why we breathe harder when working out, or when we’re in higher elevations where the air is “thinner”. Our blood pH is actually being thrown off, and the body requires more oxygen to achieve hemoglobin saturation.[^16] 

How does CO2 get into our blood stream in the first place?

## Energy Creation

Through burning fuel or ATP creation. See also, our metabolism.

CO2 production is a metabolic process.

I watched a TEDxBundaberg talk presented by Ruben Meerman (AKA the Surfing Scientist). He points out that Antoine Lavoisier discovered why we lose weight way back in the 1700s. Lavoisier discovered that respiration is, essentially, a form of combustion.[^17] 

When we eat food and breathe air, our body creates CO2 and water (H2O). Meerman quotes Lavoisier saying, “In the process, ‘nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed’.”[^18]  After all, that’s the first Law of Thermodynamics. 

Meerman continues, “When you lose weight, 8.4 kg out of every 10 comes out of your lungs.”[^19]  

Meerman actually started this quest because he lost a bunch of weight, and wanted to understand where the weight went. 

Like, literally, where did all the fat go? After falling deeper in the rabbit hole, and getting published in the British Medical Journal (with the help of a colleague),  Meerman conducted a survey. He asked family doctors, dietitians, and personal trainers the same question he’d been asking himself: “When somebody loses weight, where does it go?”

An overwhelming majority answered “Energy/Heat”. Which, not gonna lie, is what I would have answered as well. 

But, he points out during his talk, that’s impossible. “You can’t turn fat into energy because it [fat] is made of atoms, and you would need anti-matter atoms to annihilate them.”[^20] 

Meerman continues, when you breath in you inhale two atoms: O2. When you breathe out you exhale 3 atoms (CO2 = 1 carbon atom, and 2 oxygen atoms).[^21] This means that your exhaled breath is literally heavier than your inhaled breath. CO2 is literally heavier than O2. 

Okay, I’m not going to go into the nitty gritty on this, you should definitely watch this [TEDx Talk]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y1BAqOnhMM]). But essentially, all carbohydrates you eat or drink is a variation on Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. All of them.

Literally all of them. It’s in the name Carbo-(carbon) -hydrate (water (H2O)). Some carbohydrates will have more carbon, some will have more hydrogen, some will have more oxygen. 

Examples of what I mean displayed as in an elemental string:

Glucose = C6H12O6 (6 carbon, 12 hydrogen, and 6 oxygen molecules)[^22]

Fats are similar. Most fats have exclusively carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. 

Alcohol is also just a variation of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.

Proteins also have mostly Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen; however, they also contain Nitrogen and Sulfur.[^23] When you burn protein, you create carbon dioxide, water, urea, and sulphate. (The latter two end up as waste products and are excreted into your nearest toilet.)[^24]

Okay, that’s a lot. Stay with me. We’ll get to the point together, I promise.

## Metabolism

So if CO2 is formed by means of metabolism, does breathing effect our metabolisms? 

If what and how we *eat* can alter how our metabolism functions, can how and what we *breathe* alter it as well?

> According to the *Sinus & Nasal Specialists of Louisiana*, yes. You can improve your metabolism through various breathing methods and proper breathing techniques. Which is absolutely insane, crazy pants.[^25] 

So, how does metabolism work? 

There are two different metabolic pathways in the body. 

1. Anabolic Pathway: This pathway requires energy and smaller molecules to build a different, bigger molecule, such as creating glucose from CO2, or building proteins from amino acids.
2. Catabolic Pathway: This pathway breaks down complex molecules and releases unused energy. It breaks down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into molecules that are more accessible for energy used in the future.[^26]

The body will break glucose down (with the help of oxygen) through a process called Cellular Respiration.[^27] Cellular Respiration is a form of metabolism in the catabolic pathway.

> One of the metabolic ways our body uses to break down food uses oxygen to help create heat and ready-to-use ATP (energy) for the body.

This can get super involved and complicated, but what I’m trying to point out is the body needs oxygen to help break down food on an atomic level. 

A triglyceride (C55H104O6) is the fat in your fat cells that you try to burn off when you lose weight.[^28] When you breathe in O2 you “burn” triglycerides via your metabolism, and you create CO2 and H2O. 

If that’s confusing think about how a fire is generated. What is required to keep a fire alive other than a spark? 

Oxygen. In fact that’s how back drafts occur. When a fire has consumed all the oxygen in a given space, and suddenly a burst of oxygen is re-introduce to the once suffocated fire, the flame will reignite. Many times in the form of a violent burst of flame.

So, oxygen keeps the “heat”, the burning energy, going in our bodies. 

This is wildly over simplified, but it helped me wrap my head around this concept. So, I thought it might help you, too.

> Remember: Respiration is a combustion.

The end result of everything your body breaks down is CO2 and H2O (and maybe some other stuff like urea or sulphate, you little protein monster, you).

Regardless of the diet you’re on or what workout you do, if you lose weight, you create CO2 and H2O as a by-product. 


## Back to Breathing

“A human who is lying perfectly still needs about 3.5 ml of oxygen, and about 2.6-2.9 ml of CO2 will come out of them, per minute per kilogram of that person’s body weight.”[^29] This is called your Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR). This is what your body requires to survive. Even when you’re asleep, your body is burning energy.

So, how do we lose weight?

Meerman answers, “Don’t eat that much carbon back in.”[^30]

He’s basically saying just don’t eat as much—especially sugars (simple carbohydrates).

But how does this relate to breathing?

## Breathing and Weight Loss

Okay, so how does this relate to breathing and weight *loss*.

Consider a sugary soda. Let’s say the soda has 70g of sugar in it. 

I’m not going to dig into the math here, but essentially, it would take an average adult male about 4 hours (if not longer depending on their RMR) of not eating anything else, to “breathe off” this sugary soda. 

Does that mean you’ll lose weight just by exhaling all day long? 

Technically, yes? 

But think about it before you start hyperventilating. 

Essentially, what that question is asking is this: If I don’t eat food, will I lose weight?

I mean yeah, but you’ll also die eventually. So, realistically, no, just breathing is not a good way to lose weight.

If you walk, that average adult male might burn that sugary soda in about 1 hour (again this will vary).[^31]

If that person runs, it will take less time to burn.

When you move your body, you’re breathing more to prevent low O2 levels in the blood stream. You’re creating more friction inside the body. The body is forced to turn glucose into energy. The more the “combustion of respiration” has to work.

What about calories?

Calories (energy in food) are essentially carbon and hydrogen atoms. So, it’s basically the same thing. But now that you know where the energy is displaced to (CO2 and water), you can think about what you put in your body a little differently.
 
The question just shifts for a similar outcome: 

How long would I have to not eat and exhale for the atoms I’ve consumed to leave my body? 

vs. 

How many miles do I have to jog to burn off this milkshake?

## How Does This Relate To Different  Breathing Techniques 

Armed with all the above information, we must ask: If CO2 creation is directly linked to our metabolism, can we alter our metabolism through different breathing techniques? Meaning, if we change how much oxygen we take in through breathing, will that effect our metabolic rate, and therefore burn more energy and create more CO2. 

If this is true, then breathing techniques could, again, be incredibly useful as we can control the amount CO2 we exhale.

Dr. John Douillard writes, “The average amount of air that is inspired or expired during one breath is about 500 milliliters of air. This is called tidal volume. The inspiratory reserve volume, which is the extra amount of air that could be inhaled if the breathing was maximal, is about 3000 milliliters. Adding this to the tidal volume (500 milliliters) equals an inspiratory capacity of 3500 milliliters, which is at least six times the amount most people inhale. Breathing to one’s full respiratory capacity (3500 milliliters) could potentially support the exhalation of CO2 or fat-burning six fold.”[^32]

Let me restate just one part of that for the people in the back:

> The average human only uses one sixth of their lung capacity.[^33]

Basically, what John Douillard is saying is that if we use the full capacity of our lungs, we could lose weight faster by safely inhaling more oxygen and exhaling more carbon from our bodies.

## How Do I Breathe More Efficiently? Tell me NOW!

Douillard continues, “To access full respiratory capacity (all five lobes of the lungs), breathing must be maximally efficient, and this can only happen when we use the body’s primary breathing apparatus—the nose.”[^34]

Douillard conducted a study, published in the *Internal Journal of Neuroscience* which proved several interesting points re: nose breathing over mouth breathing. I am both paraphrasing and quoting directly from Douillard’s article.

1. No change in heart rate - Because the mouth is literally a bigger hole through which to breath, you’d think breathing through your nose would actually increase the heart rate. (Remember, when the CO2 levels in our blood get high and O2 levels get low, our bodies need us to breath more to create homeostasis in blood pH and hemoglobin/O2 association.) Douillard’s study found that the heart rate stayed the same during both nose breathing and mouth breathing. This suggests, “an ease and comfort during exertion using nose breathing that was unprecedented.”[^35]
2. Nose breathing is actually more efficient. When subjects were asked to ride a stationary bike, their rate of breath for nose breathing was actually lower than that of mouth breathing. Nose breathing also allowed subjects to use all five lobes of the lungs.
3. Perceived exertion was lower.
4.  Parasympathetic Nervous System Activation. (If you’ve read my other articles, it should not surprise you that this was the most fascinating to me.) “Parasympathetic nervous system activation increased significantly during nose breathing as compared to mouth breathing. The receptors for the parasympathetic nervous system are found concentrated in the lower lobes of the lungs.”[^36] (Remember, the importance of [diaphragmatic breathing](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/breathing)?) 

> Douillard continues, “This suggests that nose breathing more efficiently accesses the lower lobes where most of the fat-burning or CO2 exchange takes place.”[^37]

5. Brain wave measurement proves to have more coherence with nose breathing.

> 6. The brain wave patterns associated with deep relaxation and meditative conscious were higher with nose breathing.

7. Endurance was proven to be higher than with mouth breathing. “When CO2 builds up due to inefficient breathing, both endurance and recovery time will be compromised.”[^38]

Okay, this touched on a few things. I want to break them down here.

### Nose Breathing

The nose was built specifically for breathing. Jae Berman for *The Washington Post* writes, “The nose is built with a specific purpose: to support our respiratory system (the primary purpose of the mouth, on the other hand, is to start the digestive process). The nostrils, hair and nasal passageways are designed to assist in filtering allergens and foreign bodies from entering the lungs. The nose also adds moisture and warmth to inhaled air for smoother entry to the lungs.”[^39]

Here’s where things get both a little counter-intuitive, but also start to make sense. 

Berman continues,

> Nasal breathing allows “for more oxygen to get to active tissues. 

That is because breathing through the nose releases nitric oxide, which is necessary to increase carbon dioxide in the blood, which, in turn, is what releases oxygen. Mouth breathing does not effectively release nitric oxide, which means the cells are not getting as much oxygen as through nasal breathing, which could lead to fatigue and stress.”[^40]

#### Wait, Wait, Wait. What Was That About Nitric Acid?

According to J. O. Lundberg et al, authors of *Inhalation of Nasally Derived Nitric Oxide Modulates Pulmonary Function In Humans*, “Nitric Oxide (NO) is produced in the paranasal sinuses and is excreted continuously into the nasal airways of humans.”[^41]

James Nestor, author of *Breath: The New Science of A Lost Art*, “One of the many benefits [of nasal breathing] is that the sinuses release a huge boost of nitric oxide, a molecule that plays an essential role in increasing circulation and delivering oxygen into cells.”[^42] 

> Fun fact: Your nose contains erectile tissue. Yup, erectile tissue. “The same flesh that covers the penis, clitoris, and nipples.”[^43] Viagra actually works by releasing nitric oxide into the bloodstream. This opens the capillaries in the genitals as well as other areas.[^44]

Nestor continues, “Nasal breathing alone can boost nitric oxide sixfold, which is one of the reasons we can absorb about 18 percent more oxygen than by just breathing through the mouth.”[^45]

So, nose breathing creates more NO than mouth breathing because NO is created in the nasal passage. NO helps deliver oxygen to our cells and boosts circulation. Therefore, nose breathing is more efficient than mouth breathing. 

**Nitric Oxide, Nasal Breathing, and COVID-19**

COVID-19 is not the first Coronavirus epidemic to occur. If you remember, between the years 2002-2004, the world experienced the SARSCoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) epidemic. According to Lam et al, authors of *Overview on SARS in Asia and the World*, SARS proved to be the first major novel infectious disease to spread on a global level in the 21st century.[^46] Like with all experiences, there were definite takeaways from SARSCoV. 

I could write an entire article on this, and I might in the future; so I’m going to zoom in a bit here. 

Because the SARSCoV epidemic happened almost 20 years ago (yikes), a lot of testing has been done on the disease. 

According to Dr. Rosalba Courtney, one study “showed that nitric oxide inhibited the replication of SARSCoV in a dose dependent manner, meaning that higher levels had a great inhibitory effect on the replication of the virus.”[^47]

> Let me be clear here: nasal breathing has *not* been proven to prevent the contraction and replication of COVID-19. 

However knowing that nasal breathing might help decrease our risk, and inserts some control over something that has made us feel helpless on a global level, might at least help decrease stress levels and boost our immune systems in the process. 

### Breathing Diaphragmatically

I literally wrote an [entire blog](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/breathing) on just this one bullet point. I suggest you read that, because I’m not going to put it all here. 

TL;DR: Diaphragmatic breathing has been proven to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system. Meaning, even if you’re pumping up the sympathetic nervous system by asking a lot of it, like running for example, you can train your body to enter a calmer mental state, making the work out more meditative.

Nasal breathing helps tap into breathing diaphragmatically, and breathing into the lower lobes of the lungs, filling your lungs to their fullest extent. 

A group of scientists actually tested the RMR and VO2max on a group of subjects after each individual performed diaphragmatic breathing techniques.

(VO2max is the maximum rate of O2 your body is able to use during exercise. Tim Jewell writes, “the greater your VO2 max, the more oxygen your body can consume, and the more effectively your body can use that oxygen to generate the maximum amount of ATP energy…ATP power your cells and helps release the CO2 that’s created [during metabolism].”[^48])

These scientists found a significant difference in VO2max and RMR before and after the prescribed diaphragm breathing exercise. The same study asked subjects to breathe with a feedback breathing device.[^49] From the results they determined, “both diaphragm breathing exercise and feedback breathing exercise could enhance cardiopulmonary function.”[^50]

And, since diaphragmatic breathing has been shown to increase O2 intake, it has been proven to help increase your metabolic rate, too.[^51]

### Holding Your Breath

Okay, here’s where breathing techniques really come in. There are so many breathing techniques floating around in the world that require some sort of breath retention. 

Take Box Breath for example. 
1. Breathe in for x count (most recommend starting with a 4 count)
2. Hold for x count
3. Breathe out for x count 
4. Hold for x count 

According to Ana Gotter, box breath has now officially been prescribe to and used by “athletes, Navy SEALs, cops, and nurses.”[^52] It has been used to help combat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and depression. It is even considered beneficial for those with lung diseases such as Chromic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).[^53]

Breath retention therapy is nothing new. 

The *Sinus & Nasal Specialist of Louisiana* point out a specific breath retention technique called Kumbhaka Pranayama. (Kumbhaka Pranayama is a yogic breathing technique that is very, very old.) “It can help increase your oxygen intake, expand your lung capacity, stretch the intercostal muscles of your rib cage, and improve your metabolism.[^54] 

(For my yogis out there, Kumbhaka Pranayama requires the activation of both the Jalandhar and Mula Bahdhas as well as Ujjayi breath. Go [here](https://www.yogajournal.com/poses/types/pranayama/breath-retention/) for more in-depth info.)[^55]

#### But Why Do People Say To Never Hold Your Breath?

In the West, breath holding is nearly exclusively linked to disease. And, we’re not entirely wrong. Sleep apnea (a condition in which your tongue, throat, and soft palate relax during unconsciousness to the point of blocking your airway) has been linked to hypertension, arrhythmias, stroke, coronary heart disease, metabolic dysregulation, etc.[^56] 

Additionally, Linda Stone, writer, researcher, and former Apple and Microsoft executive, discovered something called “email apnea” (AKA tech apnea). Stone noted that up to 80% of people unconsciously hold their breath, or breathe exceptionally shallowly, when composing emails.[^57] Experts are noting that email apnea, or tech apnea, occurs due to our stress levels increasing for a variety of reasons. And those stress levels tense our muscles, particularly our breathing muscles.

Alan Fogel, author of *Waiting to Exhale*, writes, “Holding your breath means that your breathing is restricted because of increased tension in the muscles responsible for breathing.”[^58]

Susan Pollak, author of *Email Apnea* published on the *Psychology Today* blog, writes, “Dr. Margaret Chestney and David Anderson at the National Institute of Health (NIH) demonstrated that holding one’s breath contributes to stress-related diseases and disturbs the body’s balance of O2, CO2, and NO, which help keep the immune system strong, fight infection, and mediate inflammation…Shallow breathing can also trigger a sympathetic nervous system response…If we’re staying in this state of emergency breathing and hyper-arousal for extended periods of time, it can not only impact sleep, memory, and learning, but also exacerbate anxiety and depression.”[^59]

So, Western science has told us, and proven, that holding our breath when both awake and asleep is detrimental to our physical and mental health.

Then why does box breath and Kumbhaka Pranayama not only work, but have positive effects on both our physical and mental health?

### Anxiety & Breath Holding

Let’s conduct an experiment: 

Exhale all the air out of your body.

Now hold that moment. 

Don’t breathe in.

Just Hold it. 

Count to three.

Now inhale.

Breathe naturally.

How did that feel?

There’s a sense of panic associated with suffocating. Your lungs urge for more. Your chest might attempt to expand creating a nagging tugging at the back of your throat. 

Many people have panic attacks if this moment is prolonged. Which, in turn, might make them feel like they’re dying.

Interestingly enough, scientists have recently discovered that the fear associated with suffocating (or not breathing) doesn’t come from the amygdala (the fear center of the brain). 

James Nestor, the aforementioned author of *Breathing: The New Science of A Lost Art*, writes, “The nagging need to breathe is activated from a cluster of neurons called the central chemoreceptors, located at the based of the brain stem. When we’re breathing too slowly and carbon dioxide levels rise, the central chemoreceptors monitor these changes and send alarm signals to the brain, telling our lungs to breathe faster and more deeply. When we’re breathing too quickly, these chemoreceptors direct the body to breathe more slowly to increase carbon dioxide levels.

> This is how our bodies determine how fast and often we breathe, not by the amount of oxygen, but by the level of carbon dioxide.”[^60]

Nestor explains that chemoreceptors are a basic function of life. The most basic life forms have chemoreceptors to gauge how much carbon dioxide is being inhaled and exhaled.[^61]

Nestor continues, “As humans evolved, our chemoreception became more plastic, meaning it could flex and shift with changing environments. It’s this ability to adapt to different levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen that helped humans colonize altitudes 800 feet below and 16,000 feet above sea level.”[^62]

> “Today, chemoreceptor flexibility is part of what distinguishes good athletes from great ones. It’s why some elite mountain climbers can summit Everest without supplemental oxygen, and why some free divers can hold their breath underwater for ten minutes. All these people have trained their chemoreceptors to withstand extreme fluctuations in carbon dioxide without panic.”[^63]

 So what’s the difference between sleep and email Apnea vs. box breath and Kumbhaka Pranayama? 

The answer: 

Consciousness and intentionality. 

With the apneas your body is unconsciously holding your breath. 

With box bvreath and Kumbhaka Pranayama, you’re consciously, intentionally, training your chemoreceptors to tolerate CO2 fluctuations.

Like I said before, this is not new science. Carbon dioxide therapies have been around since the ancient Romans soaked in thermal baths. Over time, physicians in the Alps began to “bottle up carbon dioxide and administer it as an inhalant. The therapy was so effective that it made it stateside in the early 1900s.”[^64]

Even though pills and creams replaced it, this science has never been disproven. In fact, it has been further proven in recent studies.

It has also been proven that “those with the worst anxieties consistently suffer from the worst breathing habits. People with anorexia or panic or obsessive-compulsive disorders consistently have low carbon dioxide levels and a much greater fear of holding their breath. To avoid another attack, they breathe far too much and eventually become hyper sensitized to carbon dioxide and panic if they sense a rise in this gas. They are anxious because they’re over breathing, over breathing because they’re anxious.”[^65]

You can reverse this by literally breathing less. In a recent study conducted by professor of Psychology Alicia Meuret, subjects were able to prevent panic attacks by “breathing slower and consciously increasing their CO2.”[^66] 

Stephanie Pappas, author of *To Stave Off Panic, Don’t Take a Deep Breath*, writes, “The treatment works by normalizing the baseline levels of carbon dioxide in the blood…making people less prone to hyperventilation and giving them the tools they need to reverse an attack.”[^67]

The conscious increase of CO2 in the body via breath holding can actually help with everything from anxiety disorders to asthma to COPD.  

(Semi-Side Note But Also Very Related: Breath retention has also been shown to aid in weight loss because it forces the body into an anaerobic state—it forces the body to burn energy from fat stores to produce energy rather than cellular respiration.[^68] However, this is not a magic bullet, and I’m not saying hold your breath forever to lose weight. I’m saying if you’re a healthy adult, and can hold your breath comfortably for 20 seconds, try to hold your breathe for 20 seconds or so when you taking a walk. I’m absolutely not asking you to, or suggesting that you should, asphyxiate yourself.) 

I would like to add as well that breath holding has been proven to increase nitric oxide as well.[^69] Dr. Rosalba Courtney writes, “The concentration of nitric oxide in the nasal passages and the naso-pharynx increases after breath holding with voluntary closure of the soft palate [(The soft palate is the soft part of the roof of your mouth. You can close it by literally plugging it with the back of your tongue or sucking on a straw.)] In cases of nasal obstruction, breath holding after exhalation for up to 30 seconds can reduce nasal resistance and the effects last over time.”[^70]

### Freeze Response and Breath Holding

Because I brought it up, I feel obligated to explain tech apnea a little more. 

When we are anticipating something, it is not uncommon for us to hold our breath without actually realizing it. This is what tech apnea is. 

For me, I most equate this feeling with grade school or college, and that moment right before my graded exam hit my desk.

This same reaction can occur when you open Instagram expecting likes, or when you’re waiting on an important email response.

This concept of breath holding in the face of stress made me start to question the “freeze” fear response. 

When I was a kid, I had an extremely active imagination. (Who am I kidding, I still do.) I have also always been a light sleeper. 

The smallest noise would wake me up. The creak of a stair. The shift of the house. The flow of water through pipes in the ceiling. The wind blowing leaves against my window.

And, because my imagination is so vivid, and my anxiety so relentless, my mind would immediately bring up the absolute worst scenario. Typically, for childhood Emily, this would mean one thing: There’s a monster in my closet.[^71]

I remember laying as still as possible in my bed. Sweat beading on my forehead and temples. My muscles would start to cramp from being held in one position for so long. All the while, I would strain to hear the noise again.  My eyes would play tricks on my mind, making it look like the closet door was perpetually opening just slightly. 

If you have ever felt this response, you might be able to recall what your breathing felt like. 

It most likely felt shallow and light, with your inhales deeper than your exhales. It was kind of like quietly hyperventilating. Like with tech apnea, during stress responses such as this, your body de-prioritizes deep breaths and you might stop breathing all together at times. 

When I thought about this, it honestly felt like it went against everything I thought I knew about breath. Why would we stop breathing in stressful situations? Wouldn’t we want *more* oxygen?

First, we have to look at the fear response: Freeze. 

According to the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center, “Just like fight or flight, freezing is an automatic, involuntary response to a threat. In a split second, the brain decides that freezing (rather than fighting or running away) is the best way to survive what’s happening.”[^72] 

As a child, when there’s a monster in your closet, you know that can’t fight it—you’re too little. And you can’t run away—it’s already in your room. 

So, you freeze.

Remember this fear isn’t the same kind of fear created by lack of oxygen or CO2 in the body—that panic is induced by your central chemoreceptors. 

Remember, fear response is based in the amygdala.

Christopher Bergland, author of *Neuroscientists Discover the Roots of ‘Fear-Evoked Freezing”* writes, “Before deciding to flee or fight, most mammals freeze for a few milliseconds to assess the situation before making the next move.”[^73]

Bergland explained that a group of neuroscientist at the University of Bristol found “a chain of neural connections stemming form the cerebellum. When activated by a real or imagined threatening stimuli, these neural connections can cause the body to automatically freeze.”[^74]

But Emily, didn’t you *just* say the amygdala is the root of our fear response?

Way to pay attention! I did say that, Dear Reader! 

And, since science is amazing, scientists discovered the amygdala isn’t the only part of the brain that allows us to experience fear and the fight, flight, or freeze response.

Almira Vazdarjanova, author of *Chasing “Fear Memories” To the Cerebellum*, writes, “The cerebellum has long been known as the center of fine motor control and sensory-motor integration [muscle memory—like playing the piano]…Recently, the cerebellum also has been implicated in acquiring and expressing ‘emotional’ associative learning, which is commonly believed to depend entirely on forebrain regions. Specifically, the learning and memories for an association between neutral and fear-eliciting stimuli, also known as ‘fear conditioning’, often are said to reside in the basolateral amygdala.”[^75]

Vazdarjanova continues to explain that a study conduction by “Sacchetti and colleagues” proved that the cerebellum plays a role in “emotional learning and memory by revealing that the cerebellum is essential for consolidating memories for both tone and contextual fear condition for several days longer than the base lateral amygdala.”[^76]

> The cerebellum holds on to tonal and contextual fear memories.

Okay, back to Bergland and the Bristol researchers. 

“The periaqueductal grey (PAG) is a brain region responsible for dictating how humans and animals respond to perceived danger. The PAG has long been known to receive various inputs about potential threats and trigger automatic reflexive responses that cause us to freeze in place, give us the blood flow to swiftly flee, or the adrenaline rush to fight.”[^77]

The neuroscientists at the University of Bristol found a particular brain pathway that led from the PAG to “a highly localized part of the cerebellum called the pyramid, which causes the body to automatically freeze in place.”[^78]

So why do we hold our breath in a freeze response?

As previously mentioned, the freeze response typically kicks in when we feel trapped—a child hiding from a monster in her closet. In this instance both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are activated simultaneously.[^79] 

The simultaneous flooding of both stress hormones and “rest and digest” hormones can slow our heart rate and breathing to the point of holding our breath. It has also been observed that pain killing hormones can be released in these circumstances to reduce physical and emotional trauma. This can also affect our memory.[^80]

> Freezing when feeling trapped can force our body to prepare for a traumatic experience to the point where we literally don’t feel it or remember it.

In extreme cases, this is called dissociating behavior. It is most commonly found in trauma victims.

While this might be useful in situations of extreme trauma (like a victim of sexual assault) or as an evolutionary response to predators (“playing opossum”), our bodies can experience this on a daily basis, like being asked a question in a classroom, enduring a high-stress interview, giving a presentation, or in certain social situations. Our minds can go blank until the threat has passed.[^81] Long-term freeze responses, as you might guess, [aren’t a heathy state of being](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/breathing).

If you experience an unnecessary freeze response, psychologists suggest doing things to either snap you out of the response or performing an act that might boost the parasympathetic nervous system and decrease the sympathetic nervous system such as (list yoinked from Modern Therapy Online):

1. Splash cold water on your face
2. Inhale a strong scent
3. Look at pictures of loved ones (humans or pets)
4. Rub your hands together
5. Use your hands to perform a creative task (such as knitting, drawing, or painting)
6. Stroke an object with a soft, soothing texture
7. Listen to music
8. State a positive mantra out loud, several times
9. Take an slow walk and observe what’s around you[^82]

(Not to totally blow your mind, but there is a fourth fear response called “Fawning”. Exactly what it sounds like, fawning looks like performing people-pleasing behaviors, active conflict avoidance, and inability to speak up for ones-self when threatened.[^83] The best analogy I can think of for this is when an aggressive dog runs up to a more submissive dog the submissive dog will literally show its belly. Go to a dog park. You’ll see this behavior all the time. It’s not a sign of cowardice, instead, it’s literally the submissive dog’s way of tell the aggressive dog, “Hey, you’re in control here. You’re the best. I know it. You know it. Just let me live safely in this space with you.”)


## This Was A Lot of Information

You’re not wrong. When all said and done, this article is a little over 8,000 words. If I printed it out, it would be about 16-17 pages. This is officially longer than some of the papers I had to write in grad school. 

So yea, it’s a lot. 

Let’s recap:

We started with understanding how breathing works, and understanding that CO2 is actually just as important as oxygen when it comes to body homeostasis, and oxygen retention. 

We then learned that when we burn energy our bodies create carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). When we burn energy, and lose fat, we are literally breathing out those atoms as they turns into CO2 and water inside of our bodies. Technically, this means we can “breathe ourselves skinny”, but it’s not a feasible option as it would essentially require us to fast constantly—which is extremely unhealthy. 

Instead, we must abide by the age-old rule of eat less and move more. But we can aid in our metabolism by breathing more efficiently. 

We can breathe more efficiently by inhaling and exhaling through our noses. Nasal breathing allows for more oxygen absorption as more nitric oxide and carbon dioxide are created.

We can also breathe more efficiently by inhaling and exhaling into our bellies rather than our chests. Diaphragmatic breathing can help trigger the parasympathetic nervous system, and fill all five lobes in our lungs. This can not only help us breath more efficiently in relation to your resting metabolic rate, but also when you are exercising. In fact, nasal breathing diaphragmatically is more effective than mouth breathing diaphragmatically. 

We also learned that holding our breath consciously and with intention has several psychological and physiological benefits. Holding our breath can actually help prevent panic attacks from becoming full-blown, and can help ease asthma and COPD through teaching our central chemoreceptors—a basic function of all living organisms—to calm the f down. It’s called carbon dioxide therapy, and it’s been around since the at least the ancient Romans (and prior due to the breathing techniques found ancient yogic texts).

Lastly, we discussed the freeze response and breath holding. Again, breath holding during a freeze response is actually an unconscious act. Therefore, being in a “frozen” state can be extremely detrimental to our health. The frozen states occurs when we feel trapped, and our body prepares us for a traumatic experience. We can feel this in traumatic experiences such as sexual assault or a home invasion, when we believe there’s a monster in our closet, *or* when called on in class, or speaking publicly. 

This fear isn’t only rooted in the amygdala, but also in the cerebellum, where fear-conditioning is now proven to take place. It has also been proven that our cerebellum is responsible for the freeze response via a pathway that connects the cerebellum to the periaqueductal grey (PAG) region of the brain.

Even though this was a long article, it was still a brief over view of many different subjects. As always, our breath, bodies, and brains are more complicated than what I’ve described here. However, this should hopefully give you a decent understanding of why breathing, and breathing techniques discovered many, many years ago, are so incredibly helpful to both the psychological and physiological parts of ourselves. 

For now, allow your brain to absorb the information. 

Go for a walk. 

Wear your mask, unless your vaccinated and outside.[^84]

Breathe in.

Breathe out.
