# The Science of Meditation: A Hypothesis on How and Why Meditating Can Help Depression and Anxiety (Part 1)


About three years after I moved from South Carolina to San Francisco I was diagnosed with chronic depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Two things I realized I had been struggling with for most of my childhood, into my adult life, and still do today.

I was prescribed Wellbutrin, and absolutely hated it. It just seemed to make everything worse. Though many people I know have had great success with it, it just wasn’t for me. 

Figuring out what worked for me was honestly a whole traumatic journey that I’m not going to go into here.

So, long story short, I ended up breaking up with my therapist, and just learning to cope as best I could. While I’m aware I should go back to therapy, I haven’t made the leap yet. There’s a lot of emotional overhead involved.

I mention this because I want you, dear reader, to know that this particular subject is very near and dear to my heart. It is something I deal with every damn day. So I don’t take it lightly.

That being said, when I was chatting with a group of my fellow yoga teachers last month, someone mentioned that meditation can help with depression and anxiety. And me, being the person I am, I wondered this:

> Scientifically, how and why would meditation help with depression and anxiety.

“Placebo effect, surely,” was honestly my first thought.

I know many people are on the train of if guru says it it must be true. And that’s awesome. That's an amount of faith in humans I don't quite have yet. 

My depressed, cynical brain isn’t there yet. I need the evidence. 

I need the proof.

I need the science. 

So, I went on the hunt. 

I fell down a few rabbit holes, many of which I’ll take bring you on a guided tour through. But on the whole, I never found a “why”. Many research studies just say something like those who meditate have more serotonin and dopamine and less depression and anxiety. And those who don’t, have less serotonin and dopamine and more depression and anxiety. 

I screamed, “Why though!” at my computer screen far more often than I ever thought I would. 

I’m going to be honest with you. I never got a clear cut “why”. 

I’m hypothesizing my own scientific why. This is based on a metric shit ton of research, and my very surface level understanding of neuroscience. 

Even still, you might find it interesting.

This post is dense. So dense in fact, I’ve been working on it for over a month and, as of this post, I’m still not done. But curious minds tend to be impatient minds, and I wanted to give you something to start chewing on while I finalized this beast. This is the first installment of a five part series. 

> “The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.”[^1]

## Parasympathetic and Sympathetic Nervous System

I know I’ve discussed these two systems [before](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/breathing#fn:31), but I’m going to do it again.

We’ll start simple and dig deeper as we go. 

The Nervous System is responsible for:

1. Coordinating all the activities in the body
2. Allowing the body to respond and adapt to changes both inside and outside of our skin suits[^2] 

The nervous system, at its highest level, can be broken down into:

1. The Central Nervous System: brain and spinal cord
2. The Peripheral Nervous System: almost all of the nerves that connect to the spinal cord[^3]

The Peripheral Nervous System then splits into two more branches:

1. The Somatic Nervous System: It carries motor and and sensory information. It is made up of the nerves that connect to the skin, sensory organs, and skeletal muscles. It allows voluntary muscle movements and processing external stimuli (sight, sound, and touch).
2. The Autonomic Nervous System: It ensures that the basics of our bodies run without us having the think about it. Examples include: breathing and keeping our heart beating.[^4]

The Autonomic Nervous System is then split even further in two:

1. The Sympathetic Nervous System: This is our fight, flight, freeze, and fawn response, as well as meeting other energy demands (non-emergency situations such as running a marathon).[^5] The sympathetic nervous system also works at times of rest.[^6] The important thing to keep in mind when discussing any part of the body is that balance is key.
2. The Parasympathetic Nervous System: This is our counter to the Sympathetic Nervous System. When the Sympathetic Nervous system is no longer needed, the parasympathetic nervous system helps bring other key systems of the body back to their rest/normal state. This is also referred to as the “rest and digest” system.[^7]

Today, we are going to look at the Parasympathetic Nervous System and Sympathetic Nervous System as they both effect the distribution of our hormones.

When we are in fight, flight, freeze, or fawn mode our sympathetic nervous system is triggered. This triggering causes many physiological changes to occur.[^8]

According to Kirsten Nunez, author of “Fight, Flight, Freeze: What This Response Means,” “The reaction begins in your amygdala, the part of your brain responsible for perceived fear. The amygdala responds by sending signals to the hypothalamus, which stimulates the autonomic nervous system (ANS).[^9]

For the purposes of this post, it will be very important for us to understand how the nervous system and the endocrine system work together.

We experience our lives through our nervous system, and if our nervous system is a highway, our neurons on the cars on that highway.

### Neurons

Different nerves have different functions.
- **Sensory, or afferent, neurons** carry information from sensory receptors.
- **Motor, or efferent, neurons** send information to the muscles and glands.
- **Interneurons** are located primarily in the central nervous system are communicates among other neurons. These neurons allow the brain to use many different sources of information to form a coherent picture or thought from the information being provided.[^10]

So, only when the nervous system deciphers something, can the body react.

I briefly mentioned the spinal cord in my breakdown above. Let’s talk about the brain and spinal cord (or the central nervous system) for a moment. 

The spinal cord is a long, thin, tube-like bundle of nerves and other cells that runs from the brain down the spine (your spine protects your spinal cord, in case you missed that day in biology).[^11] The spinal cord is the central highway for almost all of the information for the body. “Within the spinal cord, ascending tracts of sensory neurons relay sensory information from the sense organs to the brain while descending tracts of motor neurons relay motor commands back to the body.”[^12]

> “When a quicker-than-usual response is required, the spinal cord can do its own processing, bypassing the brain altogether.”[^13]

This is called a reflex. Think of touching a hot stove and pulling your hand away before you realized it was hot. Or, maybe catching your phone without realizing you dropped it.[^14]

### How Do Neurons Actually Send Those Signals Though?

Okay, get this. Right now, it is estimated that the brain contains 85 BILLION neurons.[^15] A primary functional unit of the nervous system, a neuron is a nerve cell.[^16]

Neurons pass signals from one to another. This is how the nervous system works. 

In the following example, the neuron initiating the signal is called the presynaptic neuron.[^17] The receiving neuron is called the postsynaptic neuron.[^18]

Neurons will vary in size and shape, but generally they have two sides. One one side, you’ll find dendrites. This is where neurons receive most of their information. Dendrites contain receptors designed to pick up signals from other neurons. These signals are actually chemicals called neurotransmitters.[^19]

The neurotransmitters, picked up by the neuron’s dendrites, cause electrical changes in the neuron. The soma of the neuron, located in the middle of the dendrites, translates these electrical changes.[^20]

The soma contains the nucleus of the cell. Which, as you might remember from biology class, contains the DNA (genetic material) of the nerve cell. The soma gathers all of the information from the dendrites and puts it together in an area called the axon hillock.[^21] 

If the electrical signal in the axon hillock triggered by the neurotransmitters received by the dendrites is strong enough, the signal is then transferred to the axon. This is where the signal is renamed to “action potential”.[^22]

The action potential is sent down the axon (which is protected in a substance call myelin—think insulation for your nerves). The action potential then reaches the other side of the nerve cell.[^23]

This side is of the neuron where the the axon terminals, or synaptic buttons can be found.[^24] 

![Dr. Marc Dingman. \2-Minute Neuroscience:The Neuron. Youtube.](images/Neuron.png)

The synaptic buttons contain vesicles, or small sacks. Each vesicle can contain thousands of neurotransmitter cells.[^25] 

The receiving neuron, or the postsynaptic neuron sits close to the the presynaptic neuron. This space is called the synapse.[^26]

Inside the synapse, between the presynaptic neuron and the receptors of the postsynaptic neuron is the synaptic cleft. It is microscopic in width—significantly smaller than a strand of hair.[^27]

So, when the electrical signal, or action potential, excites the presynaptic neuron the vesicles will fuse with the presynaptic membrane, releasing their contents, neurotransmitters.[^28] These neurotransmitters bind to the postsynaptic receptors, causing one of two things: 
1. Increase the likelihood of an action potential in the postsynaptic cell 
2. Decrease the likelihood of an action potential in the postsynaptic cell[^29] 

![Dr. Marc Dingman. \2-Minute Neuroscience:The Neuron. Youtube.](images/Vesticles.png)

So, what happens to the neurotransmitters that didn’t bind to the postsynaptic cell? They either drift away (a process called diffusion), they are absorbed back into the presynaptic cell and are reused (a process called reuptake), or enzymes breakdown the neurotransmitters within the synaptic cleft.[^30] 

### Location, Location, Location

Something to keep in mind about the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems is where they originate. 

Meaning, the sympathetic nervous system actually originates in the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord.[^31] Basically in your middle and lower back.  

In the sympathetic nervous system, neurons do not typically travel from the spinal cord directly to their target location. Instead, neurons extend from the spinal cord to clusters of neurons off of the spinal cord (the peripheral nervous system) known as ganglia.[^32]

The cluster correlating to the sympathetic nervous system are call the sympathetic ganglia. There is an exception, however. That exception is the sympathetic neurons that travel to the adrenal medulla (the little triangle-shaped thing superior (on top of) to your kidneys). They do not cluster, but instead go directly from the spinal cord to the adrenal medulla.[^33]

The sympathetic nervous system primarily uses norepinephrine as it’s neurotransmitter.[^34]

The parasympathetic nervous system originates in the brain stem and the sacral spinal cord. Basically at the base of your brain and just above your tailbone.[^35]

Like the sympathetic nervous system, neurons do not travel directly from the brainstem or sacral spinal cord. They extend to clusters, also known as ganglia.[^36]

However, for the parasympathetic nervous system these clusters are known as parasympathetic ganglia. 

The parasympathetic nervous system typically uses acetylcholine as it’s neurotransmitter.[^37]

But, because the parasympathetic nervous system originates in the brain steam, things work slightly differently. But, we’ll get to that later.

Part 2 will be up next week. We will discuss the Endocrine System!
