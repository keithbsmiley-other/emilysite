# Veganism & Vegetarianism: Protein Anxiety, Iron Deficiency, and Conscientious Eating

Like most, my undergraduate university required a handful of required general education courses. So many courses in history. So many in math. So many in a foreign language.[^1] And, so many in science. They offered nutrition as one of the sciences, and I, a journalism major, thought it might be the easier of my options.[^2]

Now, I was not that into nutrition at the time. I thought eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich was eating *healthily*.[^3]

I don’t remember a lot about the class, I’m not going to lie. The professor lost me when she required us to memorize the purposes and deficiencies of all the major vitamins.[^4] Anyhoo, one of the things I do remember, is that she said being a vegetarian is one of the healthiest diets you can possibly maintain.

Undergrad-Emily was unimpressed. Who, in college, can afford to buy fresh produce? I mean honestly. 

Currently, I both agree and disagree with my old nutrition professor. With the assumption that, as a vegan or vegetarian, you eat mostly fruits, vegetables, and grains. In fact, being a plant-based diet *can be* extremely beneficial. But, there’s a lot of foods that are technically vegan and vegetarian that are not good for you.

Seriously, I once had a friend of mine tell me about how amazing her vegan experience was over beer and Oreos. 

What I’m trying to say is: Just because you’re eating a plant-based diet doesn’t mean you’re eating a healthy diet. 
 
In order to truly understand how to eat a *healthy* plant-based diet, we need to understand that magical macro: Protein.

I touched on protein in a [previous article](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/fad-diets-and-macros), but I didn’t really dig into it (protein consumption and digestion get fairly complication fairly quickly).  So, let’s dip a little more than our toes into the protein pool of knowledge, shall we?

To review, protein does a lot of the heavy lifting in the body. It helps build strong hair and nails, and is a huge part of building (and strengthening) our bones and muscles. Some proteins help transport hormones to the appropriate areas, and others act as messengers for other molecules that have important reactions in the body. Our red blood cells contain protein, and keep our blood oxygenated.[^5] Every cell in the human body contains protein.[^6]

> We *need* protein to survive. 

Unlike other macros, protein is not stored in the body. Therefore, we have to replenish it through consumption.

## What is protein, really?

Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids. When you eat a protein, it is broken back down into a vast assortment of these chains. So, when we say the body needs protein, we mean the body needs amino acids to maintain good health.[^7]

There are over twenty amino acids that make protein. Since the body doesn’t store amino acids, the body must make them in two different ways: “either from scratch, or by modifying others”.[^8]

That being said there are three categories of amino acids. 

### Nonessential
- Alanine
- Asparagine
- Aspartic acid
- Glutamic acid
- Serine

### Conditionally Essential Amino Acids
- Arginine
- Cysteine
- Glutamine
- Glycine
- Proline
- Tyrosine

### Essential Amino Acids
- Histidine
- Isoleucine
- Leucine
- Lysine
- Methionine
- Phenylalanine
- Threonine
- Tyuptophan
- Valine[^9]

The body can synthesize nonessential animo acids in most cells from glucose and other essential amino acids.[^10] It’s actually pretty fascinating if you start digging into it. 

> “Cells in the body can provide the carbon skeleton of the nonessential amino acids. These carbon skeletons come from intermediates of the glycolysis pathway and from intermediates in the Kreb’s Cycle. The alpha-amino group can be added by enzymatically catalyze transamination of pre-existing amino acids using...enzymes called transaminases.”[^11]

Basically, the cells in your body take the basic carbon structure of an amino acid, and, through the Kreb’s Cycle, allow enzymes to attach other molecules to the skeleton to create a non-essential amino acid. Your body literally creates more complex carbon-based materials within itself. If that’s not amazing, I honestly don’t know what is. (I’ll admit, this was a bit of a tangent, but I mean, come on!) 

Anyway, you still need protein to get those essential amino acids. Now, here’s where it gets complicated: You can have complete and incomplete proteins. Meaning, there are proteins out there that have *some* of the essential amino acids, but not all of them. 

Let me explain.

## Complete and Complementary Proteins

A complete protein is a protein that has all nine essential amino acids. You are most likely to find complete proteins in animal-based proteins: fish, poultry, meat, dairy products, and eggs. 

An incomplete protein contains some, but not all, essential amino acids. Most grains, like rice, are too low in lysine to be considered complete; however, legumes like beans are higher in lysine. Badda. Bing. Badda. Boom. You’ve got all the essential amino acids. Plant-based foods such as this are commonly referred to as complementary proteins.[^12]

Want to know something really cool? You don’t even have to eat rice and beans in the same meal (but I mean c’mon, a veggie burrito is where it’s at). It’s less about what you eat in one meal, and more about what you eat over the course of the day.

So here is where, for me anyway, being a vegan or vegetarian would get extremely complicated. You have to be so incredibly cognizant of what you eat. You really need to know what are plant-based complete proteins and what are plant-based complimentary proteins. It’s also helpful to keep track of what you’ve eaten all day to ensure you get all of the amino acids your body requires (we’ll talk protein RDAs in a bit). That's just a lot to think about on a daily basis.

I’m not saying it’s impossible. Obviously, it’s not. People do it successfully all the time. I’m not even saying it’s *that* hard when you really get it down. But the barrier of entry is pretty high for those that don’t know much about nutrition. 

### Examples of Plant-Based Complete Proteins:
-  Quinoa
- Soy
- Buckwheat
- Hemp
- Spirunlina
- Tempeh
- Amaranth
- Ezekiel bread

### Examples of Plant-based Complementary Proteins:
- Hummus and pita
- Nut butter and whole grain bread
- Beans and rice[^13]

## Protein Anxiety

A quick reminder: for non-athletes, the RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) for protein is .8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.  So, I, for example, weigh about 135 pounds, or 65.235 kg. 65.235kg x .8 grams = 48.988 grams.[^14] So, I should be eating about 49 grams of protein a day. 

Honestly, that’s not that much. 

There’s 38 grams of protein in 1 cup of chicken. <br/>
There’s 40 grams of protein in half fillet of salmon. <br/>
There’s 62 grams of protein in 1 steak (that weighs about 251g).[^15]

However:

There’s 8 grams of (complete) protein in 1 cup of quinoa.<br/>
There’s 9 grams of (complete) protein in one cup of cooked green peas.

I mean, sure, I could eat 6 cups of quinoa in a day to ensure I get enough protein, but do I want to? Also, have you even eaten a lot of quinoa in one day? Yeah, me neither, it’s a lot of freaking food. It's also a lot of calories.[^16] 

I watched a lecture yesterday with a professor, Dr. Neal Barnard, MD, in which he discusses “protein anxiety”. Essentially, he says the most common question he gets when he mentions eating a plant-based diet is: But where do you get your protein?  He explains, “If I am on a 2,000 calorie diet, and all I eat is broccoli I’ll have consumed 146 grams of protein.[^17] If all I eat is lentils, I’ll have consumed 157 grams of protein”. He went on and on like this for a while. Then he says, “The A.N.D. (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics) weighed in on this and said, ‘Vegetarian and Vegan diets typically meet or exceed the recommended protein intakes...(then he paraphrases) as long as you’re eating food.’ He then equates “protein anxiety” to not getting enough oxygen when breathing air. Obviously, he’s being a little snark machine here saying if you breath air you are getting enough oxygen; therefore, if you eat food you get enough protein.[^18] He’s not wrong. Protein deficiency in the United State just doesn’t happen, like at all.[^19] The body may not run on all four cylinders (or whatever the hell the saying is), but it’ll be...fine.

But here’s where I disagree.[^20] Mostly because Oreos and (many) beer are vegan. Most pre-packaged pasta is vegan. A metric shit ton of candy is vegan.[^21] A plethora of spirits are vegan. Taco Bell’s bean burritos (sans cheese) are vegan. Pillsbury crescent rolls are vegan. Pop Tarts. Krissy Kream Fruit Pies. Thomas bagels.

Anyway, I think—I hope—you get my point. If you don’t, my point is this: Sugar, tone of “the greatest threats to cardiovascular disease” in the United States, is vegan.[^22] There’s a lot of shit out there that’s vegan, and *not healthy*. I mean, spinach is only but so tasty. You know what *is* tasty *all the time*? Pasta. Candy. Oreos. Beer. Simple carbohydrates. Sugar.

Dr. Neal Barnard, MD, and my nutrition professor is making a giant assumption: Everyone eats as cognizantly as they do. When the fact is: Most Americans do not eat cognizantly.[^23]

If we did eat mindfully, would the prevalence of obesity be in nearly half of the American population?[^24] Would “obesity-related conditions including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancers be (sic) some of the leading causes of preventable, premature deaths (sic)” in the United States?[^25]

Answer: no.

> There is more—much more—to food choices than the nutritional cotent of the food chosen.[^26]

Emotional eating, and other things we literally all do because we’re not freaking automatons aside, there’s something else I haven't mentioned yet that is even more important than protein when discussing veganism and vegetarianism: Iron deficiency.

## Iron

Iron deficiency is, actually, on the rise in the United States. I am certainly not trying to imply that it's on the rise due to an increase in plant-based diets. A lot of the iron deficiency is due to poor diets in general. But a plant based diet *might* actually work against you here.

Okay, this is about to get a little more in-depth. Let's take a quick break.

Stand up. Shake it out. Dance around.

You look ridiculous, and I absolutely love it.

Okay, sit back down.

Deep breath in. Deep breath out. 

Let’s talk about blood.

Your red blood cells contain a protein called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of your body. Without enough iron, your body can’t produce enough hemoglobin.[^27]

This lack of hemoglobin (or red blood cells) is called anemia. 

> Not to scare you or anything, but anemia is essentially when you begin to suffocate from within your own body.[^28]

The most common kind of anemia is iron-deficiency anemia.[^29]

Symptoms include:
- Weakness
- Shortness of breath
- Dizziness
- Fast or irregular heartbeat
- Pounding or “whooshing” in your ears
- Headache
- Cold hands or feet
- Pale or yellow skin
- Chest pain[^30]

How do you become dietarily anemic? If the food(s) you’re consuming lack(s) iron, folic acid, and/or vitamin B12, mainly. You know what has all of those things? Animal protein.

See a pattern? Typically the foods that are high in protein are high in iron. I’m not saying that meat-eaters don’t suffer from iron-deficiency anemia. Some people have a harder time absorbing iron than others. However, it’s far less likely to happen when eating an animal-protein diet simply because you’re exposing your body to more absorption opportunities.

A recent study in the Journal of Nutrition & Food Sciences compared the overall health of vegetarian and non-vegetarian women. It found that vegetarian women had significantly lower BMIs than those that had animal-protein diets. “However, all vegetarian women had some degree of iron deficiency anemia—60% were mildly anemic, and 40% were moderately anemic. Non-vegetarians experienced far less iron-deficiency anemia, with 47% mildly anemic and only 7% moderately anemic.”[^31]

The RDA for iron varies greatly depending on age group, hormonal changes, etc. However, to simplify, we’ll say the median dietary intake of iron is 16-18 mg/day for (adult) men, and 12 mg/day for (adult) women.[^32] The RDA for vegans ands vegetarians is 1.8 times higher.[^33]

Why is it so much higher? Well, dear reader, I’ll tell you. 

There are two different types of iron: heme and nonheme.[^34] “Plants and iron-fortified foods contain nonheme iron only, whereas meat, seafood, and poultry contain both heme and nonheme iron.”[^35] Guess which type of iron is more bioavailable (more likely to be digested and used by the human body). Go on. I’ll wait. 

You got it! Heme iron is more bioavailable!

> “The bioavailability of iron is approximately 14% to 18% from mixed diets that include substantial amounts of meat, seafood, and vitamin C (as ascorbic acid, which enhances the bioavailability of nonheme iron) and 5% to 12% from vegetarian diets.[^36] In addition to ascorbic acid, meat, poultry, and seafood can enhance nonheme iron absorption, whereas phytate (present in grains and beans) and certain polyphenols in some non-animal foods (such as cereals and legumes) have the opposite effect.)[^37]

This means, my herbivorous homies, it’s best to get your iron from dark, leafy greens. Grains and beans tend to work against your iron absorption. Just plan on eating *a lot* of dark, leafy greens to maximize absorption.[^38]

Plants-based foods containing lots of iron:
- Spinach
- Legumes
- Pumpkin Seeds
- Quinoa
- Broccoli 
- Tofu
- Kidney beans
- Kale
- Cabbage
- Raisins
- Dates
- Apricots

## So, What’s My Point?

Let me start off by saying this: If done correctly, a vegan or vegetarian diet is good for the environment, good for your heart health, and, as far as animal ethics are concerned, extremely commendable.

But, I’m also not going to sit here and pull what my nutrition professor did, and uneviquicolly state that vegetarian and vegan diets are the healthiest diets you can possibly eat. There’s just a too big of an caveat to be added to that statement. 

Whenever you cut a huge source of nutrients out of your diet, you have to make up for it by eating with extreme intention. You have to be aware of everything you put in your body.[^39] Yes, arguably, you should be doing this anyway. But, who are we kidding?  I’m a nutrition coach, and I had Halloween candy for my second breakfast.[^40] 

What I’m getting at is this: If you have the will power to be a vegetarian or vegan or whatever combination of plant-based you want to be, I support you whole-heartedly. 

Just do your due diligence to learn what a healthy plant-based diet looks like, make educated decisions, and let everything you eat count.[^41]
