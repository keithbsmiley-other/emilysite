My husband recently made all of my old photos accessible to my phone (rather than keeping them on a hard drive that we almost never looked at). I was scanning through these old photos when I came across our wedding photos. 

I said to my husband, “You know, our wedding was beautiful; I had an absolute blast. But, our honeymoon was probably one of the best trips we’ve ever taken together. I just remember being so content there.” 

My husband chuckled, and said, “Just content, huh? Not happy or anything else?”

What he didn’t understand was: To me, being content is a huge accomplishment. 

# Contentment

Background: A few years ago I was diagnosed with chronic depression and generalized anxiety disorder.[^1] 

I’m not saying it's a struggle to get out of bed everyday. For me, my depression takes the form of extreme self-hatred. I’m constantly battling my own inner-hater. 

There are days when I get the best of it. 

But, there are also days when it gets the best of me. 

Days when I truly believe I’d be better off quietly sitting in a corner. Absolutely nothing I say deserves to be heard, and no one would want to hear it anyway. 

Those days are exhausting and infuriating.  

So, believe me when I say this: When you are constantly battling a chemical imbalance in your brain that’s telling you you're worthless, 

> Feeling content is like being high. 

Let’s not confuse contentment with happiness here. Yes, I was happy on my honeymoon. Shit, we were in Kaui with absolutely no responsibilities. Of course I was happy. 

Contentment is an entirely different thing though, and, like all human experiences, it’s different for everybody. For me, it's a feeling of being settled and safe. It’s the acceptance of where you are in your timeline, and being accepted by those around you. 

So, when my husband said, “Just content, huh?” I thought: “What do you mean *just content*? That was the most at peace I’ve ever felt!”

Then I realized, a lot of my understanding behind “contentment” comes from my studying yoga. No, I'm not going to say to go study *The Bhagavad Gita*.[^2]  I’m just saying, I have a different understanding of the world than the Webster’s definition.

In yogic philosophy, Contentment is the act of letting go, and allowing (read: accepting) things to just be. It is to be at peace with the consequences of everything around you. One might see this as “Letting Go and letting God”. Others might see it as the Universe doing its Universe-y thing. 

> For me, it’s about being at peace with myself, and getting that shitty voice in my head to shut the fuck up for a little bit. 

Like all things, this will evolve. With time, I’ll have a deeper understanding of contentment, and what it means to me. Much like ogres and onions, there are layers to these things. We strive to continue to peel each back, delicately, one at a time. It’s a part of learning about ourselves, and our place, in this time on this world. 

I think I’ll hold on to this concept of studying Contentment for a little while, and see where it takes me. It'll be a fun little experiment.

# Goals

We were walking our dog one morning, and my husband asked me, “What are your resolutions?”

I responded with, “I don't believe in resolutions.” 

He laughed, and said, “I didn't realize you don't believe in goals.”

After rolling my eyes, I said, “Of course I believe in goals. I just don't think an arbitrary date is a good reason to set a goal. In order to succeed, you have to want your goal for more reasons than just flipping a page in a calendar.”

Statistically speaking, only nineteen percent of people maintain their resolutions. In fact, most people abandon their resolutions by mid-January.[^3] So really, if you’re just setting a goal, or resolution, “for the gram”, you might as well not even bother. 

There’s this thing called the Transtheoretical Model of Change. It’s studied in several fields from psychology to personal training. It’s not perfect, and doesn’t take certain things into account (like assuming everyone makes logical decisions, and “the social context in which change occurs”).[^4] However, it’s a good place to start re: understanding the psychology of behavior modification.

There are six stages in the Transtheroretical Model of Change.

1. Pre-contemplation: There is absolutely no intent to make a change in the near future. In fact, people don’t even realize their behavior is problematic.[^5] (This was me in about April/May of 2020. When I was making several different cakes a week, and eating them all without a care in the world.)
2. Contemplation: There is a recognition that something might be wrong with one’s current behavior, but ambivalence toward change may still be prevalent.[^6] (This was me in about August/September of 2020. I realized that eating all the cake wasn’t good for me, but, I mean, my pants still fit so meh.)
3. Preparation (Determination): Change is coming within the next thirty days. Small steps toward change may be occurring.[^7] (Me now. I want to change, and I did eat only half a bagel sandwich for breakfast rather than the whole thing. I’m calling it a win.)
4. Action: Recent changes (within the past six months) have been made with the intention of maintaining those changes.[^8] (Hopefully, me in the future. Maybe by June or July 2021.)
5. Maintenance: Maintenance of the changes (more than six months) are taking place with the intent to keep up the new behavior. (Hopefully, me twenty pounds lighter and, overall, having healthier eating habits around November/December of this year.) 
6. Termination: In this stage there is no desire to go back to the unhealthy behavior, and will not relapse (see: [why fad dieting literally never works](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/fad-diets-and-macros)). This stage is rarely reached, many stay in the maintenance stage until they relapse.[^9]

> Change takes time. Change takes contemplation. Change takes determination.

Even if you do find yourself in the Preparation or Action stage, you may not know how to *make* a goal.

For example, “I want to physically feel better this year,” is not a goal. It sounds a lot like a New Years Resolution, or, maybe, the impetus for a goal, but it’s not a goal.

Goals are specific beasts.

Goals are thought through. 

For example: 

I want to physically feel better this year. This is not a goal. It’s a desire. One might argue, it’s the contemplation-preparation stage of my behavior change.

In order to feel better, I need to eat healthier, and lose weight slowly and without fad/crash dieting to avoid a relapse.

Even still, I need to be more specific, and acknowledge that this is a goal that will take time. It requires me to change my habits in a very long-term way. 

All goals should have three things:

1. A declaration
2. A quantifiable target
3. A *reasonable* deadline
4. A means through which you plan to accomplish your goal (not necessary, but I find it helps).

## Long-term goal
A goal reads like this:
I will (declaration) lose twenty pounds (a quantifiable target) by June 1, 2021 (a reasonable deadline) through intelligent decision-making around meals, and conscious eating (a means through which I  plan to accomplish my goal). 
*(Note: I like to make my declarations in the affirmative future tense. “I will do X.” It takes away any question marks. “I wants” don’t necessarily happen. “I wills” are just a matter of time.)*

## Short-term goal
I will only eat a food with added sugar twice a week. 
This is a short-term goal. It is also indicative of what needs to happen in order for me to achieve my long-term goal (conscious eating) without removing the “unwanted behavior” entirely—which can result in an early relapse back into the “bad behavior” and result in my quitting all together. Essentially, short-term goals are baby steps.[^10] 

My short-term goals will evolve as my habits change, and my environment changes. Maybe, eventually, my short-term goal will be: “I will only eat a piece of cake a month,” but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

You can have several short- and long-term goals, but your short-term goals should always support one, specific, long-term goal like pillars holding up a house on the beach. 

Without those pillars, your long-term goals could be washed away when your environment changes, and you find yourself in more “risky” situations.

# Contentment and Goals

So, how does contentment play into goals and resolutions? Doesn't being content mean you should be accepting of everything around you, and therefore not need to ever set a goal?

Let go and let God, right?
 
Okay, here's the thing: I can accept that I gained twenty pounds in 2020. I can approach that without feeling angry, bitter, or like I failed myself. Mostly because 2020 was a vicious hell scape, and I’ll eat whatever the fuck I want, thank you very much. 

That doesn't mean that I don't acknowledge I’d feel better physically and mentally if I ate a spinach omelette tomorrow for breakfast rather than chocolate chip pancakes.[^11] 

Contentment doesn't neglect you of free will or the desire to better yourself. It frees you hating yourself because you made a choice that may, or may not, have been right, or wrong. 

So, yeah, contentment and goals go hand in hand. In fact, they work in perfect harmony with one another. 

Contentment, remember, is accepting things as they are. It’s about letting go of things we no longer have control of. I no longer have control of what I ate last night, and the decisions I made to get myself there. I do have control of my decisions today, though.

> For me, that’s an extremely powerful thing to realize. 

Contentment may not speak to you today, or anytime in the near future. But if you do decide to make a goal this New Year, or a resolution, set yourself up for success. Support your long-term goals with smaller, more attainable goals. And if you screw up, **it’s okay**. Try again tomorrow. 

Whatever your goals are, know this: None of this is easy. I’m not saying it will be, and I’m certainly not offering a quick fix. I'm just offering the tools to help all of us along the way. 

Tools cannot fix that which is broken without hands to guide them.[^12]
