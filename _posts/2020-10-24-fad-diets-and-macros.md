Just as there have always been, there are a lot of fad diets out right now.[^1] Trust me, I know, because I've tried most of them. The Atkins diet is a big one. As is the ketogenic diet, the South Beach diet, and the Zone diet, to name a few.[^2]

My point is there's a metric shit ton of them out there, and a lot of people have idea what it is they need (I blame listicles), or don't need, to actually put into their body. So, I'm here to help clarify a few things.

As someone who struggles with self image, jumps on fad diets for, sometimes, years at a time, and then epically plunges into the black abyss that is binge eating sugary treats, I can say with full confidence:

> Almost all fad diets are absolute bullshit.

(Sure, keto, specifically, has its place among *some* people. A lot of doctors prescribe it to diabetics; it keeps blood sugar levels consistently low. It also has been studied in children on the autism spectrum, and was fond to be a "potentially beneficial treatment option to improve the core features of autism spectrum disorder and warrants further investigation."[^3] My point is: if you don't *need* this diet, there are much easier ways to lose weight than mainline avocados, and staring at the fruit section in the grocery store like it's a really good porn.[^4]

Most fad diets aren't sustainable. They're exhausting. A lot of them aren't even actually healthy. And, let's be honest, most of them aren't very yummy.

So, to truly understand why fad diets are the absolute worst, we must educate ourselves. This article will focus on the fad diets that specifically alienate macros, or macronutrients, since they're so big right now.[^5]

Macros are named such because you need a lot of each of them. There are three main macros: Fats, Carbohydrates, and Protein.[^6]

## Fats

Okay, first things first. Your body *needs* *fat*. There, I said it. I would shout it from the mountain tops if I could, but I can't so I'll say it again:

> In order to be a healthy human being, you need to physically consume fats.

Fats give your body energy. They support cell growth. They help you produce hormones, and absorb nutrients. They protect your organs, *and t*hey keep you warm.[^7]

(If you're a low-fat lifer, I've got bad news for you. Most low-fat products are loaded with sugar. That's the only way food manufacturers can get you to eat their products. So, you know, eat fats.)

But, like all good things, too many fats can be bad for you. So, let's break this shit down.

There are four different kinds of fats. Some are healthy. Others are not so healthy. Our goal is to put the good fat in your body in higher amounts than the bad fat. This is how we prevent heart disease and stroke.

Let's start with the least healthy type of fat and move our way up, shall we?

### Trans fat

The least healthy of the fats in trans fat. Small amounts of trans fat occur in animal protein (meat and dairy products). Those aren't the ones you really ned to worry about, because the dosage is so low. It's the artificial stuff that's the real problem for most of us (and when I say most of us, I mean most of us globally. Trans fats are a problem all over the world, not just in the U.S.)

Trans fat increases bad cholesterol (LDL) and, *actively lowers good cholesterol* (HDL). It is linked to creating inflammation in the body and increases you risk for heart disease and stroke. It can even contribute to insulin resistance.[^8] (Psst, insulin resistance is a fancy way of saying pre-diabetes or full blown Type 2 Diabetes depending on individual glucose levels.) So, again for effect:

> Trans fats literally work against your health.

You may be thinking: Emily, who would put such a vial thing in the foods I eat? Well, I'm about to tell you.

Pretty much everyone used to. That's a lie. Not *everyone*. (Maybe your grandma didn't? I don't know. I don't know her personally.) But, you know, a lot of restaurants (specifically fast food), companies that sell anything with fat in it that needed to extend the food's shelf life. (Think Twinkies. Those shits are like the cockroaches of the snack world. They never die.)

Healthier fats---like unsaturated fats---have a really short shelf life. They go rancid very quickly. This can be problematic for grocery stores, food manufacturers, and households alike. And it was problematic, especially before refrigerators were commonplace (1930s-1940s).

In the early 1900s, a German chemist figured out how to hydrogenate liquid fat to produce a semi-solid fat. Thus, giving birth to trans fats. They let food stay on the shelf for longer, they were cheap to make, and they were easy to put into food. Therefore, food manufacturers immediately gobbled them up.[^9] (Fun fact, the first product to contain trans fat was Crisco vegetable shortening.[^10])

Trans fats became really big over the next eighty years. "By the 1980s, many food manufacturers and restaurants had stopped using tallow and lard, replacing these fats with trans fat-based products, which had similar smoke points and were thought to be healthier."[^11] Spoiler alert: they were not.

Real world examples of trans fats include:

- margarine
- packaged snack food
- fried food
- anything hydrogenated
- commercially-baked pastries

The good news: The U.S. has banned artificial trans fats from commercially sold food products, and the World Health Organization called for a complete elimination of artificial trans fat by 2023.[^12]

> But be aware!
> "By law a serving of food containing less than .5 grams of trans fat can be labeled as 0 grams. Therefore, it's important to also check ingredient lists for the term 'partially hydrogenated'."[^13]

 

TL;DR: Actively avoid trans fat to be the best of your ability---especially outside of the U.S. Even in the states, check your nutrition labels. Big Snack is out there, waiting, with their Cheeto dust-covered finger tips slowly taping together like a villain in a children's movie.[^14]

### Saturated Fat

Like trans fats, saturated fats can raise your LDL cholesterol, but there's a caveat. Saturated fat can raise your LDL cholesterol if *eaten in excess*. The American Heart Association recommends limiting your saturated fat intake to five to six percent of your caloric intake.[^15] Others have said to limit your caloric intake to no more than ten percent of your total daily calories.[^16]

Where can you find saturated fat:

-   *all* animal meat (Less so in poultry and fish, but it's still there---especially in the skin of poultry.)
-   coconut
-   coconut oil
-   palm oil
-   dairy products (whole and reduced fat milk, butter, etc. Also, sorry Wisconsin, this includes cheese.)

Think about it like this: foods high in saturated fat will, typically, be a solid in room temperature.

I'll be completely honest, a handful of recent studies have found that saturated fat might not be all that bad for you after all. Which, I'm sure at least a few of you are yelling that at me right now as you read this.

Well, stop it. I'm not trying to steal your saved up bacon grease, and I don't like getting screamed at. See what you made me do? You made me end my sentence in a preposition. Calm yourself. Read on.

Most scientists and most studies agree that saturated fat can increase your LDL cholesterol. (Stop yelling.) However, there are at least three studies that I'm aware of that argue saturated fat might not increase your risk for heart disease. (See I'm agreeing with you). Those same reports, though, concluded that you absolutely can lower your bad cholesterol if you replace saturated fat with polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat (see next section).

So, say you're sautéing vegetables for dinner, and you have the choice between butter and olive oil to lube up that pan. Do you go for something that may or may not be bad for you and your family? Or do you grab something that is definitely healthier?[^17]

TL;DR: Within reason, saturated fat isn't *terrible*, but it ain't *that* great for you either.

### Monounsaturated and Polyunsaturated Fats

Monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats help to

-   lower risk of heart disease and stroke
-   lower bad LDL cholesterol levels, and increase good HDL
-   prevent abnormal heart rhythms
-   lower triglycerides (fat-based molecules found in the blood stream)
-   lower blood pressure
-   prevent hardening and narrowing of the arteries

Essentially, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats are the Batman and Robin (respectively) of cholesterol. (They also say that these healthier fats help you to feel more satisfied, and therefore, reduce your appetite between meals. I did not experience such a phenomenon when I tried these diets, but I have the appetite of a 300-lb sumo wrestler. So, I, personally, think "they" are a bunch of liars whose pants are surely on fire. Whoever "they" actually are.)

Food high in monounsaturated fats are:

-   olive oil
-   peanut oil
-   avocados
-   almonds, hazelnuts, and pecans
-   pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds

Foods high in polyunsaturated fats are:

-   Walnuts
-   Flaxseeds
-   Fish
-   Sunflower, corn, soybean, and flaxseed oils

### Omega-3 and Omega-6 Fatty Acids

This article, while already longer than I anticipated (and I'm not sorry, not sorry one bit), is an incredibly brief overview. However, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the special snowflake fatty-acids that reside under the proverbial roof of polyunsaturated fats.

Your beautiful human body can make most fatty acids. In fact, it can make all but two of them. The two your body absolutely, one-hundred percent cannot make are linoleic and linolenic acids. But we *need* them to be healthy humans. So, we have to ingest them. This is why they are most often referred to as essential fatty acids.[^18] Linoleic and linolenic acids are derived from foods containing omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. They also have anti-inflammatory properties.[^19]

You'll find these fatty acids mostly in salmon, trout, sardines, flaxseed, and walnuts to name a few.

### How Fats Relate to Fad Diets

Okay, here's where the fad diets come in. Atkins, keto, and the like---the diets that essentially encourage high fat intake and low carbohydrate intake---are extremely misleading.

Let me break it down.

First, let's talk calorie counting. I intentionally didn't include counting calories in my fad diet list, because, honestly, it's not a fad diet.

This could be an entirely new article (and might be later), but here's the short version: Our body are machines. They need calories (energy) to burn in order to not literally shut down. If we take in too much energy, our body stores it in the form of glycogen and fat. When we have a calorie deficit, our body taps those reserves for energy.

Therefore, the only way to actually lose *body fat* is to eat less calories than we burn. It's simple math.

Fat, unsurprisingly, is energy *dense*. One gram of fat contains nine calories. That's a lot of energy in one tiny gram of fat.

So, if you're looking at macro-based fad diets, you see a lot of your calories come from fat. Most of them, actually. But because fat is so energy dense, you don't need to eat a lot of it---if you're trying to lose weight.

Remember, keto/Atkins/Whatever doesn't in and of itself make you lose weight---the calorie deficit does (you might lose water weight, but that's a different conversation). So, even though you may have mathematically filled your energy requirements for that meal, are you really satiated?

Like I said before, a lot of people claim fat-heavy diets reduce their appetite, and it might for them. It did not for me. That handful of pork rinds and three tablespoon of guacamole for lunch did not fill me up. Just sayin'.

Which leads me to my next gripe, and the more important one.

> Not all fats are created equally.

So, when some poor soul sees that keto allows them to eat all the sour cream, all the bacon, and al the cheese they could ever want---they're all in! Which, duh, sounded great to me, too.

You guys, *cream cheese is keto*. But saying cream cheese is keto is like saying Oreos are vegan. Just because it's true doesn't mean it's healthy.

My point: When people eat high-fat diets they aren't necessarily eating the *right* fat. That's the major difference.

Again, all of this is in an effort to lose weight. Most people don't jump on the high-fat low-carb bandwagon due to an underlying medical condition. So keep that in mind when I say this:

Even if you eat the correct kind of fat, high-fat low-carb diets are still really bad for you.[^20]

## Carbohydrates

So, let's say you've got 1500 calories allotted for the day. A high-fat low-carbohydrate diet might have the macro math of something like this:

70% of calories from fat

25% of calories from protein

5% of calories from "good carbs"[^21]

And remember, it's more important to get fat than it is to get your carbs in these diets. Fat is the fuel you've taught your body to burn (rather than glycogen---sugar).

Quick math:

At 9 calories/gram of fat you're looking at about 116 grams of fat. At 4 calories/gram of protein you're looking at about 94 grams of protein. At 4 calories/gram of carbohydrates you're looking at about 19 grams of carbohydrates. So, a day of meals might look like this:

Breakfast

-   3 slices of bacon (10g fat; 9g protein)
-   one cup of avocado (21g fat; 2.9g protein; 12 g carbs)
-   2 tablespoons of olive oil (28g fat) (for cooking---yeah, that shit counts too)
-   2 eggs (10g fat; 12g protein)

Lunch

-   an ounce of pecans (20.4g fat; 9g protein; 3.9g carbs)
-   one half a cup of chopped chicken breast (2.5g fat; 40g protein)

Dinner

-   one half of a salmon fillet (28g; 40g protein)
-   one half a cup of raw broccoli (3g carbs)

Might not seem terrible. I mean it's not a lot of food, but that's dieting, right?

Incorrect.

This is not a well rounded diet at all. Most of our *micro*nutrients come from carbs---whole fruits and vegetables specifically. I mean, sure, avocado has a bunch of good stuff in it---magnesium, potassium, Vitamins B2, B3, B5, and B6, etc. Pecans are high in nutritional value as well---vitamins A and E, folic acid, calcium, etc. Broccoli is loaded with vitamins too. But, on the whole, this example is not nearly enough of a well-rounded diet to be considered healthy. 

Say it with me: We all need carbohydrates. Say it again, louder this time: We all need carbohydrates. LET THE LORD HERE YOUR VOICES! (Any Footloose fans out there? No? Okay, cool. I mean, whatever.)

Anyway, we need carbs, ya'll. They give us nutrients. They help our bodies, and brains, run more efficiently. They supply us with immediate energy.

I'm not saying you should run to the grocery store and buy a party-sized bag of peanut M&Ms and a baguette either, though. Like fats, not all carbs are created equally.

When broken down to its smallest molecules, carbohydrates are, for all intents and purposes, sugar.

Ack! Run for your lives! The dastardly sugar goblins have kidnapped Emily! It's all lies.

Just kidding. The sugar goblins haven't gotten me yet. But before you run for the hills, take a big breath in (trust me I'm a yoga teacher), and a big breath out. Now, say it with me again:

We all need carbs.

What we *don't* need are most simple carbs. Refined sugar, cane sugar, white bread, most cereals, most pastas, for example, are simple carbohydrates. Simple carbs are the carbohydrates that your body doesn't need to break down. While some simple carbohydrates have their perks (even Coke-a-Cola can be considered slightly hydrating), they have limited nutritional value other than the immediate energy they provide.[^22] The problem is, most of the time, our bodies don't need that massive hit of immediate energy. So, it gets stored in and around our muscles as glycogen and body fat, awaiting the glorious day the Energy Gods in our bodies call upon them to be sacrificed for the greater good. And, unless we physically move our body for an extended period of time, in and around our muscles is where the glycogen will stay.[^23]

Complex carbohydrates, on the other hand, typically are your dark leafy greens, grain-based breads, legumes, etc. They are higher in fiber, and therefore slower to digest; which means they're more likely to keep your blood sugar levels fairly stable, and they provide more energy for longer periods (again because of the slower digestion). Not to mention most of our micronutrients are in those legumes and dark leafy greens.

And before you say anything, yeah, fruit is technically also pure sugar. And I'd like to throw a big 'ole BUT in right here...so I will.

BUT whole fruit is kind of amazing---if eaten within reason. First of all, if you eat a whole fruit, skin and all, up to thirty perfect of that sugar won't be absorbed.[^24] Instead, "it will be metabolized by the microbes in the gut, which may improve microbial diversity, and help prevent disease."[^25] So, you know, eat fruit.

### Fiber

I've been mentioning fiber a lot in this section of the article. That's because it's really freaking important. Fiber is what makes you poop. And before you get all grossed out let me let you in on a little secret: everybody poops. We all need to poop. It's a bodily function. Get over it.

The thing that really got to me when I was on the keto diet is that it severely limits how much fiber you can take in, because the carbs are so limited. Hard-core high-fat low-carb dieters *include* fiber in their carb intake. Which is absolutely insane, because some of that fiber is literally called "insoluble". It's food that your body can't physically break down and absorb. It's only purpose is to push your actual shit through your intestines and out your poop hole.

The total dietary fiber intake for an adult human is between twenty-five to thirty grams a day from *whole foods* --- not supplements. The total average intake right now in the U.S. is about fifteen grams per day.

So, maybe I was wrong, maybe everybody doesn't poop. Huh, maybe that's why so many people are so angry all the time. You ever seen how a dog acts after they poop? They run around like a bunch of crazies they're so happy! That could be you! Eat your freaking fiber!

Foods high in fiber:

-   Pears
-   Strawberries
-   Avocado
-   Apples
-   Raspberries
-   Bananas
-   Carrots
-   Beets
-   Broccoli
-   Artichoke
-   Brussel Sprouts
-   Dark leafy greens (Kale, Spinach)
-   Lentils
-   Oats
-   You get the idea.

TL;DR: Eat whole fruits and vegetables. Don't skip them. Eat your fiber. Poop. You'll be happier.[^26]

## Protein

I feel like protein is the one macronutrient every one can agree we need. Your hair and nails are made of protein. It helps promote healthy skin. It is an essential building block of both bones and muscles. Some proteins in our bodies are hormones, and some act as messengers for other molecules that are key reactions inside the body.

Additionally, protein is the only macronutrient that the body cannot actively store. Carbohydrates are broken down to sugar and stored as glycogen. Fat is broken down and stored in the body as lipids. There are no back-up reserves of protein in the body. They are essential to our diets. We have to eat it in order to survive.

That being said, you don't need as much of it as you might think. The current Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is point eight grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (though nutritionists seem to debate that number more and more often).[^27]

So why do weight lifters need so much more protein? Why does everyone say to drink protein shakes after a work out if you don't need that much?

All great questions.

Hold on to your butts.[^28]

Your muscles are just bundles of individual fibers wrapped in fascia (read fascia as: muscle condom) and connective tissue. The smallest components of your muscle fibers are called myosin and actin protein microfilaments. "The sliding filament theory suggests that actin and myosin overlaps, and that when they receive the signal from the central nervous system to contract, they slide across on another to create a force-producing, muscle-shortening action.[^29]

There are two ways to wear out your muscles and promote muscle growth. The first is metabolic. Metabolic overload is when you deplete the muscle of available energy (glycogen). As you force the muscle into fatigue the muscle adapts to hold more glycogen. Now, one gram of glycogen can hold three grams of water.[^30] That's how you get that good, good pump.

The second way to promote muscle growth is through mechanical overload. This is when you actually damage the protein filaments. You're most likely to do this during weightlifting or big plyometric movements. "The muscle damage initiates a repair process in which certain hormones, along with...protein, synthesize new satellite cells, which are used to repair the damaged muscle fibers."[^31] Protein literally helps to rebuild your muscles.

So, why drink protein after a big workout? Why do weightlifters need more protein? Because you've literally broken your muscles down in order to build them back up bigger, faster, stronger. Drinking protein supplements can help quicken the process.

Something to keep in mind:

> You absolutely, one-hundred percent can over eat protein. It is stored in your body mostly as fat. So, supplement with caution.

So, going back to fad macro-based diets. Honestly, protein is the one I don't really have a problem with in regards to fad diets. Protein should comprise fifteen to thirty percent of your daily caloric intake. Most fad diets are actually spot on in this macro dosage. If you're looking at a high-protein low-carbohydrate diet, I'd say refer back to the section where I go on and on about not getting enough nutrients from just protein and fat.

TL;DR:

All this is to say one simple thing: The best diet---for weight loss in otherwise healthy individuals---is one of balance and variety. Find foods that are nutrient-dense, have limited added sugars, and limited saturated fats. Eat complex carbohydrates. And for the love of all that's Holy: 

> Have an open mind! Try new foods!

We don't need fad diets to tell us how to lose weight. We just need a little bit of education, a little sense of humor, and a little bit of will power to get those bad habits out of our system.

The last thing I'll say, and I swear it will be my last.

I want you to remember this.

It's probably the most important thing I'll write.

> It's okay if you screw up, and eat the "wrong" thing.
> It’s okay if you screw up, and eat the "wrong" thing.
> It’s okay if you screw up, and eat the "wrong" thing.

And if you do screw up, and eat the "wrong" thing---like a snickers bar or whatever it happens to be---that doesn't mean you skip dinner because you used up your calories. All that does is rob your body of desperately needed nutrients.

If's okay if you screw up, and eat the "wrong" thing.

Get back on the proverbial horse for the next meal.

You don't have to be a size 0.

You just need to be healthy.

I'm here to help.[^32]

Dieting got big when some (male) Presbyterian minister in the 1800s decided people, but women especially, should eat plain foods to maintain good health and "morality". Homeboy literally believed spices and sugar led to sexual excess and civil disorder. So, expect me to write an article on that in the near future.
