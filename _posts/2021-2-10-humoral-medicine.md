Well, here it is: The second installment of my History of Dieting series. This one starts back in the ancient times. Ancient Greece in roughly 500-400 BCE, to be slightly more precise. 

Today, our concept of dieting has two meanings: 
1. What we eat as a population, i.e. the American Diet
2. Specific restrictions (calories or types of food) specifically for weight loss 

For an Ancient Grecian, the idea of a diet means something completely different. Though the word diet is derived from the greek “diaita”, calories were not necessarily restricted in ancient diets.[^1] Instead, specific foods were prescribed to create balance throughout the body.[^2] Yeah, you read that right, *prescribed*. 

Dieting back in the day was quite closely related to medical health and readily used as a medical treatment. 

> A warning: today’s article is quite heavy on medical history. 

Now that you’ve been warned: Pull up your socks, and hold on to your tuchus. We’re about to go for a little stroll down one of my favorite paths: Medical History Lane.

## Medical History Lane

We’ll start with Hippocrates. 

Ah, Hippocrates: the Father of Medicine, the author of the Hippocratic oath,   and the creator of Western humoral theory.

We can’t start talking about medical history without at least mentioning Hippocrates. Like I said, the man is the Father of Medicine. Hippocrates lived from about 450 to 370 BCE. And, despite popular belief, most of his writings were actually written by several different people.[^3]

Hippocrates, or the group of people under the pseudonym “Hippocrates”, came up with this idea of the four humors. The theory of the four humors is wrapped up in the concept of “health as a balance of hot and dry or cold and moist elements in the body.”[^4] 

The four humors were as follows (in no particular order): 
1. Black bile
2. Yellow bile
3. Phlegm
4. Blood[^5] 

Galen (129 AD - 210 AD), later added onto this theory, equating the humors with Empedoclean (another philosopher) elements (air, water, fire, and earth), “and thus became the unifying explanatory model for all nature. All plants and animals could be described in terms of humors, as could eventually metals, planets, seasons, and indeed, everything. Thus, knowing how the humors in the human body interact with the humoral forces of nature and carefully regulating these interactions became the central preoccupation of medicine and diet.”[^6] 

In his article, _The Emergence of Modern Humoralism _, Chase Breimeier points out,

> > “Other environmental factors such as geographic location, climate and planetary alignment as well as personal factors like age, sex, occupation, and diet were also influential in determining the unique humoral balance of an individual…Accordingly, treatment was unique for each individual and often involved a regiment with lifestyle (the encouragement or discouragement of exercise) and dietary changes.”[^7]

The last thing that ancient physicians saw as a determining factor for humoral balance was a patient’s personality type.[^8]

When the humors were in balance; you were thought to be healthy. When the humors were out of balance, well, all kinds of things could occur: disease, depression, “hysteria”, etc.[^9] 

Despite this very…colorful…medical concept—which we will discuss at length— ancient medicine was quite ahead of its time.[^10] Ancient intellectuals all over the world made huge leaps and bounds in the way of medicine, literature, government, art, etc. Progress was made. Progress that was recorded on papyrus and preserved for centuries.

“But Emily,” you might ask, “if so much progress was made, why were they still talking about humors all the way up to the Renaissance?”

I’ll explain, and then I’ll argue a form of humoral medicine is still practiced today.

It’s at this point on our trip down Medical History Lane that we find ourselves a bit lost in the weeds. The once clear path of progress has devolved into a barely trudge-able bramble of weeds, twigs, and those vines with the thorny stems that bite through your jeans. Yes, this part of our path is dense, and dark. So, we’ll try to get through it as quickly as possible.

To understand Renaissance medical history, you have to have at least a small understanding of world events prior. 

First thing to note: Constantinople (now Istanbul), then the capital of the Roman Empire, prided itself on being the center of Western learning. 

Catholicism began to take a serious foothold throughout the city during the 4th Century. So serious in fact, that the church began to dictate “what direction the medical world took…Any view different from the established Roman Catholic view was labeled heresy and punished accordingly…The Roman Catholic Church stated that illnesses were punishments from God and those who were ill were so because they were sinners.” [^11]

> “Suffering was seen as part of the human condition.”[^12]

Progress halted as the concern for the soul shifted attention away from concern for the body.[^13] That being said, existing ideas from antiquity and spiritual influences remained, but were not expounded upon or adapted as intellectuals discovered new information. Science took a backseat to religion. (Before you get your panties all in a wad, I’m not blaming Christianity for the fall of medical progress. Keep reading.) 

However, ancient teachings were well maintained. Constantine, a Catholic himself, began to grow concerned about how long the papyrus these teachings were written on would last. Papyrus degrades quickly. The teachings could fade, and be lost. So, he hired librarians and scribes to transpose Christian teachings from traditional papyrus to this new fangled invention: parchment. Constantine’s heir, Constantius II, also ordered works of literature to be transcribed, including the teachings from Ancient Greece and Rome. Constantius established the first Imperial Library of Constantinople. It include over 100,000 volumes of ancient text.[^14] It was glorious, and massive. 

Then came the crusades. 

The Franks and Venetians destroyed the library during the Fourth Crusade (about a thousand years after its creation). Historians can’t prove whether the burning of the Imperial Library was intentional, or occurred in one of the three blazes created during the taking of Constantinople. Either way, it burned. 

Michael Harris, author of * A History of Libraries in the Western World*, wrote,

> > “Some of the invaders realized that the books in the public and private libraries were valuable, and so began a trade in manuscripts with eager Italian buyers. Many more were probably destroyed than sold, and it is not unreasonable to assume that greater damage was done in the destruction of Constantinople by the Christians in 1204 than by the Turks in 1453…The significance of Constantinople in western civilization is great, not because of its own art and literature—although that was prodigious if not original—but because it preserved so much of classical literature through the Middle Ages when it was virtually lost in the West. Of the Greek classics known today, at least seventy-five percent are known through Byzantine copies.”[^15]  

Some works were saved. Some of the works were recopied and circulated through other texts. However, our understanding of ancient culture is extremely limited because of this. 

Along with the rise of monotheism, the world saw eight different holy wars fought on a global scale, three of the worst plagues in human history (heard of the Black Death?), and extreme famine. So, why is a nine-hundred year chunk of human history referred to as the “Dark Ages” (AKA medieval period or Middle Ages)? Societal progress (the evolution of knowledge in fields such as science, philosophy, government, and art), simply wasn’t prolific. Not lost, mind you, but slowed to a crawl. Physicians of the Middle Ages still practiced Humoral medicine as taught by Hippocrates and, later, Galen, but they didn’t push medical progress forward in any great way.

Welp, we made it. We cut through the brambles. We stomped down the twigs. We machete-ed through those pesky, thorny vines. Now, we find ourselves back on a, somewhat, clearer path. Brush off the dirt. Put a Band-Aide™ on any cuts. Ice any bumps you might have.[^16] 

I’ll give you a moment. 

Here. Have some water. 

Okay, you good?

Good.

Let’s continue down Medical History Lane, shall we?

Germany’s Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press in 1440, allowing for faster and easier communication. Moveable type was way more efficient that hiring scribes to write every letter by hand.

Meanwhile, in Florence, the Renaissance Age was starting to take shape. The Medici family, along with other incredibly rich families, started to financially support budding artists. Italian writers, politicians, scientists, and artists (Da Vinci, Descartes, Galileo, Hobbes, Chaucer, Dante…you get the idea) vowed to pull society into an Age of Enlightenment—and out of the “Dark Ages”. The humanism movement allowed for the idea that man was the center of his own universe—rather than what was taught under Catholicism. 

If you look at Ancient Greek art, and then compare it to Renaissance art, you’ll find that they are extremely similar. Why? Intellectuals during the Renaissance found the findings of Ancient Greece and Rome to be the pinnacle of human advancement. Thus they began to re-learn these teachings, and expound on them.[^17] 

All that is to say: The humors we know and love from the Renaissance aren’t exactly the same as the teachings of Hippocrates. They are the evolved version. That’s what we’re going to really zoom in on.

Finally, we’ve arrived at our destination on Medical History Lane. The road ahead is still long, and, I assure you, fascinating; but, for the sake of today, this is where we stop.

## The Humors As Understood By Physicians In The Renaissance

Reminders:
1. There are four humors: Black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood. Each humor was connected to a temperature and moisture level. “Blood was described as a hot and moist humor, phlegm as cold and moist, choler (yellow bile) as hot and dry, and melancholy (black bile) as cold and dry.”[^18]
2. It was believed that every child from birth was predisposed to have more of one humor or another. “The four humors determined a person’s physical constitution or “complexion,” which was the tendency of each individual from birth to be included toward an excess of one particular humor.”[^19]
3. The humors, and their colors, related to specific diseases and emotional states. For example, when a patient was melancholic, physicians figured they were suffering from an excess of black bile.[^20] It was a physicians job to determine how to release the excess black bile, or prescribe the patient with something to counter it to create balance in the body.

Now when I say balance, I don’t mean physicians of the Renaissance believed the human body contained a quarter of each humor. “Blood, quantitatively, is the most abundant humor. Only one-fourth as much phlegm as blood is found in the healthy body, one-sixteenth as much choler (yellow bile), and one sixty-fourth as much black bile.”[^21] 

> Trigger Warning: If you’re squeamish, maybe skip the next few paragraphs.

One way to find balance way to prescribe the eating of a certain food. Another way, was well, slightly more intrusive.

**Bloodletting**

Bloodletting was common practice all the way back to Galen.[^22] Surgeons in the renaissance continued to use bloodletting as a treatment for fever, hypertension (high blood pressure), inflammation of the lungs, and pulmonary edema (excess fluid in the lungs).[^23] 

 According to Dr. Maria Cohut’s article _Bloodletting: Why doctors use to bleed their patients for health_, medieval and Renaissance-period physicians “would choose to make an incision either close to the part of the body requiring treatment or in an opposite side of the body that allegedly corresponded to the affected organ.”[^24] Illustrations of bloodletting litter medical books from this period. You can find one such image [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gersdorff_Feldbuch_s16.jpg).[^25]

Bloodletting became so common a medical practice that barber-surgeons administered such treatments.[^26] “These individuals were men who could trim a person’s hair or beard, as well as pulling out badly damaged teeth and withdrawing blood.[^27] Ew. Ew ew. Ew.

Wanna hear something really terrifying?  Bloodletting was a fairly common practice up until the mid-19th Century. Some alternative medicines still practice leech therapy, “with some arguing that it can help improve blood flow and may even have an anti-tumor effect.”[^28]  But wait, there’s more. 

Dr. Gerry Greenstone wrote in the *BC Medical Journal*, “the leech can help reduce venous congestion and prevent tissue necrosis. In this way it can be used in the postoperative care of skin grafts and re-implanted fingers, ears, and toes. Because of concern regarding second­ary infections a ‘mechanical leech’ has been developed at the University of Wisconsin.”[^29]

However, it can be argued that because of all this blood letting, it became obvious to physicians of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance that humans needed a certain amount of blood in their body to survive. “By looking into how changing the volume of blood in the body might affect its health, doctors eventually came to understand more and more about blood circulation, the important of blood to health, and the characteristics of blood.”[^30] Which, in turn, contributed to the practice of blood transfusions “as early as the 1400s.”[^31] 

That being said, bloodletting was only a small portion of Western Humoral theory. Many times, a physician would prescribe a change in diet “for counteracting the imbalance by means of opposite forces.”[^32]

> “The goal of an individual’s personal hygiene was to keep the humors in balance, and the goal of medical therapy was to restore humoral equilibrium by adjusting diet, exercise, and the management of the body’s evacuations.”[^33]

Thanks to Galen’s adaptation of Hippocrates’ theory, nearly everything in nature related to the humors. Therefore, certain foods promoted certain qualities, and related to specific humors. “Foods that are hot and dry promote yellow bile, for example.” [^34] So, “a cold and moist distemperature would be corrected with a hot and dry regimen that might include hot herbs.”[^35] Many of the guidelines as to what food belongs in which category of humor largely based on flavor. “Pleasant-tasting foods were often seen as more nourishing, and unpleasant foods less so.”[^36] Ken Albala, a Professor of History and Cultural Ambassador for Aspictopia at the University of the Pacific, notes, 

> > “Sweetness indicates heat and moisture, which is a sure sign that a food will be nourishing. It is apparently the only flavor that newborn infants instinctively enjoy…Our natural aversion to bitter foods indicates, by the same logic, that they are not nutritious. They are the opposite of sweetness, which should mean schematically that they are cold and dry…”[^37]

In Ken Albala’s book, _Eating Right in the Renaissance_—upon which I have, admittedly, relied heavily for this part of the article—the system is described as complex and hard to follow. Even the physicians in the Renaissance struggled with the rules and guidelines for what foods accomplished the proper balance.[^38]Taste was a primary factor for sure, but other factors such as where the food came from, the texture of the thing, even the habitat in which the thing was grown or harvested were taken into account. 

“Cattle fed cold and dry oats become cold and dry; sheep fed grass become cold and moist.”[^39] If you were to eat steak from a cattle fed cold and dry oats, the black bile (cold and dry, remember?) in your body would increase.  “The predominant humor is passed from fodder to feeder down the food chain until it ends up on our table.”[^40]

Essentially, the humors boil down to one simple, yet prolific, thought experiment: You are what you eat.

What you ate, to better balance temperament also changed with the seasons. It was recommended you eat, “cooling foods in summer, and warming foods in winter.”[^41]

## That’s Great and All, But How Does This Relate To Modern Day?

Great question, dear reader. Man, you are one smart cookie.[^42]

**The Modern Western Diet**

Historian Julia Skinner, makes a lovely point in _The Epoch Times_, “While our larger cultural belief in the relationship between food and health changes over time, we are in a moment where the connection between the two is becoming re-emphasized. We see humoral theory’s legacy in common sayings (“starve a fever, feed a cold”)...Most interesting to me as a food historian is seeing long-standing humor-balancing combinations echoed in some of our most beloved modern flavor combinations, like mustard and pork or lemon and fish.”[^43] 

Humorists believed meats like fish and pork maintained moist, cooling natures. They, effectively, slowed the metabolism. “To balance out this cooling effect, oftentimes warming condiments and sides—acidic things like vinegar or lemon juice, or spicy things like mustard—would be added.”[^44]

Skinner goes on to point out that these combination of flavors actually balance each other out.[^45] The acidity of a lemon might cut the savory, gamey taste of fish. Skinner proceeded to say, low-calorie diet cookbooks in the 1970s encouraged the combination of lemon and fish as a healthy option (and they still do—because fish is pretty healthy as far as meat is concerned).[^46]  “Hardly any of these cookbooks use the word ‘balance’ (or flavors, nutrients, or whatever else) when describing the dish and its health benefits. But even if not named, the concept is still there, in the idea of bringing multiple, often dissonant flavor profiles into a dish.[^47]

Recipes that combine sweet and fatty flavors or salty and acidic flavors, “might be seen as an unwitting complement to humoral theory, that helped popularize this flavor combination in the western world.[^48]

> Did you know: “When you eat something fatty, the oils coat your tongue and eventually dull your taste receptors. Acid washes that fat away, allowing you to taste the flavors like your very first bite. This is one reason steak and red wine are best friends.”[^49]

“Ultimately, these two approaches of pairing ingredients—by layering for flavor, or for a desired nutritional result—are both informed by creating balance, whether or not the concepts of humoral theory are at the core of our modern perception of them. Balancing what you eat not only creates flavors that layer and complement well, but also keeps our bodies healthy by bringing in a variety of nutrients and keeping us from overdoing any one thing.”[^50]

Even though the reasons for a “balanced” diet might have changed with the advancement of modern medicine and nutritional study, the idea of “balance” in our palates and in our bodies is very much rooted in humoral theory.

**Alternative Medicine**

“Although humoral theory decreased in popularity, much of its ideology, including a balance contributing to one’s well-being, continued on and can be seen in alternative medicine today.”[^51] Alternative medicine focuses on more than just the physical, it zooms out to look at the whole human: physical, psychological, and spiritual. Some alternative medicines are more popular than others: Acupuncture, chiropractic medicine, herbal medicine, energy therapies (such as Reiki and Therapeutic Touch and Magnetic Field Therapy) are all considered alternative medicine. 

Why is alternative medicine, often rooted in humoral medicine and dieting, coming back? 

> “Biomedicine may not actually solve a problem and heal the patient; it only results in a cure, which does not get at the root problem.”[^52] 

For example, prolonged high stress situations can force someone to have chronic stomach pain. Biomedicine might help with the stomach pain by prescribing ultra strong Pepto, but it doesn’t always take the stress causing the stomach pain into account. 

Sometimes, alternative medicine allows for a bit more “zooming out” than biomedicine might. “Since all of these treatments and systems of alternative medicine focus on the realignment of the components of the body—whether that be the Xing and Shen in tradition Chinese medicine or the three Doshas in Ayurvedic Medicine—in order to achieve better states of health, they directly coincide with the ideology of…humoralism.”[^53]

“Although biomedicine is key in curing certain issues, the personalized care and concern for each individual as well as the focus on addressing the root problem of a disease are tremendous advantages of alternative medicine.”[^54] 

Alternative medicine can promote mindfulness, self-awareness, and a healthier relationship with food, leading to healthier eating habits.

**Ayurvedic Medicine**

In the yoga world the Ayurvedic diet is really re-gaining steam. So I wanted to give it it’s due here.

I say re-gaining because, “ayurveda is considered as one of the oldest of the traditional systems of medicines accepted worldwide.”[^55] It is also proof that the general concept of humoral medicine was founded by several different ancients cultures across the globe.

 Ayurveda “characterizes the human as the combination of three Ayurvedic principles, known as Dosha, which can have a direct impact on character and also influence disease.”[^56]

“According Ayurveda, five elements make up the universe — vayu (air), jala (water), Akash (space), tea (fire), and prithvi (earth)…These elements are believed to form three different doshas, which are defined as types of energy that circulate within your body. Each dosha is responsible for specific physiological functions.”[^57] 

Essentially, the Ayurvedic diet helps you [determine your dosha](https://chopra.com/dosha-quiz) (Pitta, Vata, and Kapha) based on your main personality characteristics.[^58] Then, you eat specific foods according to your dosha. Sound familiar? 

Good. It should. Much like the humors of Ancient Greece to the Renaissance, on the face of it, this diet is also very, very similar to the temperature and moisture of the food you put in your body, and how it relates to your overall health.

Don’t bite my head off yet, Ayruveda coaches. While there are similarities between Western humoral medicine and Aryuvedic medicine (they arrived at around the same time in ancient history, for example), I could make a very, very strong case that Aryuvedic medicine was/is way more advanced than Western humoral medicine…like way more advanced. “India has a rich history of traditional system of medicine based upon six systems, out of which Ayurveda stands to be the most ancient, most widely accepted, practiced and flourished indigenous system of medicine.[^59]

Sidenote: Ancient Egyptian and Indian medicine were so advanced it’s pretty mind-blowing. Ancient Egypt had some seriously impressive medical treatments written out on papyri you can find even today.[^60] Traditional Ayruvedic disciplines understood the importance of separating internal medicine from treatment of psychological disorders. They understood there was a different between pediatric treatment and geriatric treatment. You guys, ancient India had Ear, Nose, and Throat doctors. 

I realize I’m on a bit of a tangent at this point, but it is *really* interesting.

## Fin

This blog won’t always be this history heavy. It’s just bonkers to me that something created by ancient beings thousands of years ago still has such an important role to play in our lives today. I find it comforting that human history follows us around like a friendly shadow. It constantly reminds us to learn from our mistakes, to hold on to knowledge that works, and not be afraid to adapt and evolve that knowledge to progress society in a positive direction. 

Humoral medicine—founded in different ancient cultures all over the world— and humoral dieting are nothing new. It’s literally ancient knowledge. It was the foundation of encouraging balanced meals and complex flavor profiles. It laid the ground work for alternative medicine that has adapted and evolved for thousands of years. And even through all that evolution and learning, its footprint is still so incredibly prevalent in our lives.
