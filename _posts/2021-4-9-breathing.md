Okay, I’ve been playing with whether or not to write on this because, quite frankly, it’s a massive freaking topic. So, I’m going to supply you with an overview. The more I research this topic the more I’ll be able to tell you. But, for now, let’s stick with an overview. 

Looking at this from a very simplified view is both freeing and extremely restricting. So, if you’re into breathing exercises please know that: 

1. You most likely know more than I do at this exact moment.[^1]
2. There will be things I’m just not going to go near because they’re too complicated. This is a blog. Not a book.[^2]

A few weeks ago, I started digging deeper into breathing exercises. My interest was piqued when I was chatting with a mentor of mine. 

She asked me, "What do you think is the primary breathing muscle?" 

Because of my anxiety and desperation to impress someone I look up to, I panicked. And then, I thought about it. But nothing came to mind really. 

I thought out loud about the muscles around the tops of the lungs. I thought about how the throat pulls air in. But really I just floundered for two full minutes while she watched me through her little Zoom window.
 
When I was done floundering, she said, “Okay, take in a deep breath.”

I did. I took a few deep breaths. 

"Ah, I see," she said. "You’re a chest breather. So, your answer actually makes perfect sense for you."

The answer she was looking for, turns out, is the diaphragm. 

And the diaphragm is a freaking massive, fascinating muscle. 

## The Diaphragm & Belly Breathing

At rest, the diaphragm is shaped a like a parachute, and nestled within the rib cage. It gets its shape from its attachments: the front of the lower rib cage, high in the front of the sternum, and deep in back of the lungs and spine.[^3] 

As you inhale, the diaphragm flattens.[^4] This flattening allows the lungs to fill with air. Your ribs expands because your internal organs are hesitant, and slow, to move as the diaphragm pushes against them. That is why the ribs expand to make room for air in the lungs.[^5]

Physical Therapist Jessica Reale noted, "During inhalation as the diaphragm flattens to allow the lungs to fill with air, the diaphragm will ‘pull’ slightly on each of those attachments, effectively giving you a gentle mobilization."[^6] 

> The diaphragm is what makes your belly lift, and your ribs expand, as you breath in.

But for me, as a chest breather, I’m not really relying on my diaphragm as much as say, a "belly breather" might. 

How we breath hugely impacts our nervous system. So, let’s talk about the nervous system before we get into the other stuff.

## The Nervous System

As promised, I’m going to keep this at a very high-level overview. 

The Nervous System has a few basic purposes. 

1. It coordinates all the activities of the body.
2. It allows the body to respond and adapt to changes both inside and outside our bodies.[^7] 

Okay, now that we have that, we’re going to break this down even more. This can get dense, but we’ll power through together.

There are two major parts to the nervous system.

1. The Central Nervous System: brain and spinal cord
2. The Peripheral Nervous System: almost all of the other nerves that connect to the spinal cord[^8] 

The Peripheral Nervous System can then be split into two more branches:

1. Somatic Nervous System: It is responsible for carrying motor and sensory information. It is made up the nerves that connect to the skin, sensory organs, and skeletal muscles. It allows voluntary muscle movements and processing external stimuli (sight, sound, and touch).
2. Autonomic Nervous System: It is responsible for things we don’t have to think about such as breathing or our heart beating.[^9] 

The Autonomic Nervous System can be further split into two parts.

1. Sympathetic Nervous System: It is responsible for our fight or flight response and meeting other energy demands.[^10]
2.  Parasympathetic Nervous System: Counter to the sympathetic nervous system. When the Sympathetic Nervous System is no longer needed, the parasympathetic nervous system helps bring other key systems of the body back to their resting/normal state.[^11] 

### The Sympathetic  Nervous System

Let’s zoom in on the Sympathetic Nervous System. 

A lot of people studying the SNS, and deep diaphragmatic breathing in general, will pigeonhole the SNS to being trigger during moments of anxiety or fear—our fight or flight response. *But* that’s not all the SNS is useful for. 

Dr. Sarah McKay, an Oxford University-educated neuroscientist points out, "The SNS evolved to _meet the body’s energy demands_ to all matter of threats _and_ challenges _and_ opportunities."[^12]

She goes on to explain, "Consider a lion, an antelope, and an athlete. The lion chasing the antelope, the antelope itself, and the athlete running a 400m race all experience SNS activation that enables them to run fast and meet their particular challenge."[^13]

Which one of the being in the previous example is actually experiencing the fear or anxiety? Just one of the three—the antelope. 

Point being: Evolutionarily speaking, the SNS is *extremely* important for things beyond fear and anxiety. 

That being said, let’s talk about chest breathing now. 

## Chest Breathing

How do you know if you’re a chest breather? Take a deep breath. Do your shoulders lift to create space? Do your ribs expand more than your belly? If yes, you’re probably a chest breather. This can change over time as different things occur to us throughout our lives.

### I’m A Chest Breather. Is There Something Wrong With Me?

No. There’s nothing wrong with you. But something to keep in mind:

> Chest breathing is actually a stress response.[^14] 

That lion, antelope, or athlete from the previous example would all be chest breathing during their individual bouts. Ideally, however, they would stop, and return to belly breathing, once their sympathetic nervous systems are no longer required—when the flee, fighting, or competition stops.

Let’s talk about anxiety for a second. (Something I *do* know a lot about.)

As previously mentioned, fear and anxiety aren’t the only emotions that can trigger the SNS. But, I want to zoom in on anxiety and fear, because generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) affects 6.8 million adults or 3.1% of the U.S. population in any given year.[^15] 

Anxiety is a natural response to a perceived threat. In a fight or flight situation, anxiety is what prepares our bodies for action.[^16] Anxiety can trigger a slew of chemical responses in our bodies, such a cortisol and adrenaline production. Our bodies react accordingly. 

Our palms get sweaty. Our heart beats faster. We breath through our mouths and into our chests for maximum oxygen consumption. Our muscles tighten—even our abdominals—in preparation for running or fighting.[^17]

Anxiety was super useful for our more cave-dwelling ancestors who needed to flee from wild animals and other enemies. Anxiety is super useful now when we need to jump out of the way of a speeding car.[^18]

> Anxiety is *supposed* to be a short term reaction. However, many of us stay in these anxious emotional states constantly.

Dr. Katherine Rosa of the Harvard-affiliated Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine says, "Today we are surrounded by so many stressors that we constantly stay in this state of tension. It doesn’t turn off, and we often don’t even notice it."[^19] 

> "The result: We have become a nation of chest breathers."[^20]

(This is a bit off topic, but I feel like it needs to be said. Cortisol essentially stops non-essential systems from happening in our body. It suppresses the immune system, the reproductive system, and growth processes. It can keep us feeling on edge, leading to unnatural long-term stress-caused self-destructive habits such as emotional eating, nail biting, hair plucking or pulling, and drastic mood swings (to name a few).

Cortisol also increases glucose in your blood stream (to help make energy readily available to your body in case you need to run away—remember fight or flight response). If you don’t need to run away however, you just have extra unused sugar in your blood stream. This can screw with your insulin levels, and can cause hypertension, and decrease cardiac health. Stress-related diseases are no joke.[^21] 

Individual people, like a toxic family member, friend, acquaintance, or workplace proximity associate can cause our cortisol levels to increase. This is why boundaries are *so* important. Toxic people can literally wear down, and destroy, your physical and mental health.[^22] 

Overall, long-term anxiety and stress—whatever the cause—can leave us feeling pretty freaking crappy.[^23])
 
The goal here isn’t to keep the SNS shut off. The goal is to not let it take over when it’s not needed.

## Back to the Autonomic Nervous System

### The Parasympathetic Nervous System

As previously mentioned, the Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) is the counter to the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS). Think of the PNS as the "rest and digest" system.[^24] The PNS is what we’re trying to trigger when we practice deep belly breathing exercises. 

The way we trigger the PNS with diaphragmatic breathing is actually really, really cool.[^25]

## Belly Breathing

When asked how one should breath, Dr. Rosa said, “Like a sleeping child…If you ever watch children sleep, they all breathe from the belly and not the chest. This relaxed state is the more normal way to breathe.”[^26]

> Breathing deeply into our bellies triggers a calming response in our bodies. 

What does this mean? 

It means we can combat anxiety with our freaking breath.

We know what anxiety feels like, right? 

A quick reminder: Heart rate quickens. Sweaty palms and forehead. Dilated pupils. Fast and shallow breathing. Our mouths might become dry because suddenly saliva is not an essential need. Our stomachs may ache. All the symptoms.[^27]

Since we know the symptoms, we can point to anxiety and say, "Hey, Anxiety. I see you. I appreciate you. But, I don’t need you right now." 

Once you can stop yourself in the middle of an unnecessary fight-or-flight response, and recognize what is happening, you can actually calm your body down on a chemical level.[^28]

Try this:

Remove yourself from your distractions (or remove your distractions from yourself). Close your eyes or allow yourself to simply zone out for a moment.

Think about the last time your fight or flight response had to kick in. 

Were your shoulders rising and falling quickly?  

Was your heart beating really hard?

Were you breathing through your mouth or your nose? 

Did your palms get sweaty?

Did you feel the sudden urge to run away? Did your arms, legs, and fists clench in preparation?

Did your stomach flip?

Are you chest breathing now? Did your heart rate increase just thinking about how this feels?

Notice how you feel in this moment. Know that you are in control of your anxiety.

Now, put your hands on your belly. 

Breath in through your nose. Count to four as your inhale.

Pull the air all the way down. Imagine trying to fill your belly, all the way down to your pelvis, with fresh air. Allow your belly to push your hand away.

Image your diaphragm flattening.

Exhale slowly through your mouth. Count to six as you exhale.

Feel your abdominals kick in slightly as you exhale. 

Image your diaphragm receding back into your rib cage—back to its parachute form.

Do this six times. Allow your exhales to be longer than your inhales. 

Maybe count to four on the inhale. Count to six on the exhale.

Feel better? 

Feel calmer?

More grounded maybe? Or almost a little high?[^29]

You just put yourself in a higher-anxiety situation; and then, through your breath, chemically altered your current emotional state. 

Bonkers, right?

Yeah, bonkers.

### The Wandering Nerve
There are twelve cranial nerves attached to our brains. We’re going to talk about Cranial Nerve X (ten). Which, honestly, is the most badass name for a nerve.[^30] Colloquially, Cranial Nerve X is called the Vagus Nerve. Vagus comes from the latin root "vaga-, vag-, or vago-"  meaning to wander, or move around (vagabond, vagrant, etc). Why that root word? Because it’s really freaking big.

The Vagus nerve is the longest nerve in the body. It’s actually two nerves that start on either side of the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve runs down the throat (controls swallowing and vocalization), to the heart (stimulates reduction in the heart rate), to the intestines (regulates contractions of smooth muscles and glandular secretion), and, I’m going to argue, it continues down to your gonads.[^31] Hence the name "Wandering Nerve."[^32]

> Side Note: It’s not crazy to see a correlation from the path of the Vagus Nerve to the locations of the seven major chakras. Just sayin’.

Okay, we have this massive cranial nerve attached to the part of the brain that controls most of the Autonomic Nervous System (the medulla oblongata).[^33]

And remember, the Vagus Nerve goes all the way down the torso, essentially. So, when we breath deeply into our diaphragm we are actually activating that nerve—therefore directly stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system.

Think of it like a massage for the PNS. With deep diaphragmatic breaths, we are triggering the PNS. Which in turn, tells our body to turn down the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS), and reduce the adrenal and cortisol levels in our bodies. Not only does stimulation of the PNS decrease cortisol and adrenaline levels, it increases endorphins to encourage even more relaxation, and less muscle tension.[^34] 

> When we practice deep belly breaths, we are telling the SNS that it’s not needed _right this minute_. 

Something else I’ve noticed about diaphragmatic breathing, I actually digest food more easily. This is caused by two things:
1. Psychologist Megan Riehl noted, "Diaphragmatic breathing massages the internal organs as the diaphragm moves up and down with each breath."[^35]
2. Nutritionist Sarah Khan pointed out, "The vagus nerve stimulates and regulates digestive organs."[^36] We stimulate the vagus nerve through diaphragmatic breathing thus stimulating our digestive system.

There are literal books on the vagus nerve. If you’re interested in it, there are people way more educated on the topic than I am. Feel free to dig in. I know I will.

For now though, I’m going to step away from cranial nerve X in this blog because this is about as far as my research has taken me as of yet. 

## There Are Other Ways To Breathe

Deep diaphragmatic breathing is just the tip of the breathing techniques iceberg. It’s Breathing Techniques 101. Which is one of the reasons why I wanted to start here. I also think it’s one of the best, and most useful, resources for people with higher levels of anxiety. 

Breathing techniques used to make me uncomfortable because I didn’t understand them. I didn’t understand how important they could be do my body on a very real, chemical level. 

The more I learn, the more sold I am. The more sold I am, the more I want to research, learn, and practice. 

I’m not going to talk about any other breathing techniques in this article for several reasons. 

1. I don’t know enough about them.
2. This is a fascinating rabbit hole, and, like my research on the vagus nerve, my understanding is extremely surface level. When I’ve learned more, I’ll be back. I promise.

## The Take Away

You don’t have to be some Kundalini Guru to use breathing techniques. But, if you’re anything like me, understanding the technique on an anatomical level, may help you understand why something like diaphragmatic breathing is an amazingly useful tool in your belt. 

It costs no money to breath. Oxygen is almost always accessible and free.[^37] The practice itself is easy.

I’ll leave you with this concept. 

Life is not relaxing all the time. In fact, life is quite stressful. If we can prepare ourselves, in a safe, productive way, to deal with the constant stressors of life, why not try it at least once?[^38]

[^32]:	Fun fact: In a human fetus, the gonads actually start developing up in the stomach—not far from the diaphragm. That is where the blood and nerve supply are established. In both biological sexes, as the fetus develops, the gonads descend to the pelvic region. As the gonads move, they drag the vagus nerve along with them. The male testes finish their travels to the outside of the body. Incidentally, this is why biological males feel sick to their stomach when experiencing groin trauma. “The nerves to your testicles come out of the same plexus that serves your stomach and most of your intestines, and the pain fibers go back the same way.”
