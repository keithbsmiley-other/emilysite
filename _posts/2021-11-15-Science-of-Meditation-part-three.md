> “ ‘Who are *you*?” said the Caterpillar. 

> This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.

> Alice replied, rather shyly, ‘I-I hardly know, Sir, just at present—at least I know who I *was* when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.’

> ‘What do you mean by that?’ said the Caterpillar, sternly. ‘Explain yourself!’

> ‘I ca’n’t explain *myself*, I’m afraid, Sir,’ said Alice, ‘because I’m not myself, you see.’ “[^1]

At the beginning of [part one](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/Science-of-Meditation) of this series I briefly discussed how I went through this traumatic experience of trying to figure out what antidepressants worked for me. Many of you probably thought, “You just didn’t take the time to find the one that worked for you.” 

That’s true. I didn’t.

I was honestly excited about the idea of antidepressants. Who doesn’t want to feel better?

I can’t truly describe how I felt when on Wellbutrin. Much like Alice to the Caterpillar all I know is: I wasn’t myself. 

But in the worst way possible. 

And when you feel like a totally different person—an even worse version of yourself…

I dunno man, it scared the shit out of me. 

I’m not saying this because I think Wellbutrin is a bad drug. I know many, many people personally that have had great success with it. It just didn’t work for me. And I didn’t have it in me emotionally to go through each antidepressant to see which one would work (although I do have my theories).[^2] 

So, today we are going to take a deep dive into serotonin and SSRIs. We’ll also discuss the gut-brain axis and the enteric system.

## Wasn’t This Supposed To Be About Meditation?

Yes. But first, more neurotransmitter stuff.

Before you read on, go back and read [part 1](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/Science-of-Meditation) and [part 2](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/Science-of-Meditation-part-two). 

Without them, you’ll be lost.

Don’t worry.

I’ll wait.

Read ‘em? 

Good.

## More Neurotransmitter Stuff

### Serotonin

Serotonin is a chemical mostly found in the digestive system.[^3] According to Annamarya Scaccia, “Serotonin is made from the essential amino acid tryptophan. This amino acid must enter your body through your diet and is commonly found in foods such as nuts, cheese, and red meat.[^4] 

Serotonin has several functions in the human body. I’m going to list them rigggghhhhtttt now!

1. Control bowel movements and bowel function
2. Helps to regulate anxiety, happiness, and mood. 
3. Serotonin plays a role in becoming nauseous.
4. Serotonin stimulates parts of the brain that control sleeping and waking. 
5. Serotonin is released by blood platelets to help heal wounds.
6. High levels of serotonin can lead to osteoporosis.
7. Low levels of serotonin are associated with increased libido, while increased serotonin levels are associated with reduced libido.[^5]

As you might guess, a deficiency in tryptophan can lead to a deficiency in serotonin. A deficiency in serotonin can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders.[^6]

In fact, according to the author of “The Simplified Guide to the Gut-Brain Axis— How the Gut and The Brain Talk to Each Other”, an experiment that “compared serotonin levels of healthy controls with those of patients diagnosed with panic disorder using a PET scan, found out that the patients had about one-third lower level of serotonin 1A receptors in [certain regions of the brain].”[^7]

Which leads me to SSRIs.

### SSRIs

SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are classified as antidepressants. They are your Prozacs, Zolofts, Paxils, Viibryds, etc.

Essentially, SSRIs in and of themselves do not inject more serotonin into your body. It just stops your body from blocking the reabsorption of the chemical so the chemical itself remains more active.[^8] 

According to the UK’s National Health Service, SSRIs are “mainly prescribed to treat depression, particularly persistent or severe cases, and are often used in combination with a talking therapy...”[^9]

In the UK, “SSRIs can sometimes be used to treat other conditions, such as premature ejaculation, premenstrual syndrome, fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome. Occasionally, they may also be prescribed to treat pain.”[^10]

They can also be used to these things in the U.S. 

In fact, I know people with IBS that have been prescribed SSRIs to help regulate their system a bit better. And it works. 

**Disclaimer**
It is important to note that while SSRIs can help the symptoms of anxiety and depression, they do not cure either. An increase in serotonin levels can absolutely help to treat the symptoms of anxiety and depression. It can also help make people “more responsive to other types of treatments, such as [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy].[^11]

**Another Disclaimer**
Let me just say there is absolutely no shame in taking antidepressants.

If you have been on SSRIs and you want to come off of them, however, please, please, please refer to your doctor before you go cold turkey off of these medications. Your body will have withdrawal symptoms, and you absolutely need a medical doctor’s instructions and supervision to come off of these drugs. 

### How Can An Increase In Serotonin Help Treat Everything From Penis Problems to IBS?

**Penis Problems**
I’m not going to delve too deeply here, because it’s not really relevant to this article. Just take my word for it, or the word of [this article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108949/) that new research shows that serotonin plays a huge role  in the control of ejaculation. So far as to say, “The introduction of tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs for the treatment of premature ejaculation has revolutionized our understanding of this problem and completely altered its management.”[^12]

**PMS**
Again, this isn’t really relevant to the point of this article/series, but I’ll touch on it anyway because it’s interesting. Premenstrual Syndrome begins in a womb-having human between 7 to 14 days prior to the start of a period.[^13]

According to Danielle Tworek, and Kenneth Varano D.O., authors of “How To Relieve Premenstrual Syndrome”, “symptoms can vary from month to month and woman to woman.”[^14]

Hormones fluctuate greatly during a menstrual cycle.[^15] This oscillation of hormones create a fluctuation in serotonin specifically.[^16] “This fluctuation results in appetite changes, such as carbohydrate cravings, and may induce other unwelcome effects like bloating, weight gain, and depression.”[^17] 

**Fibromyalgia**
This one is a bit debatable.[^18] It’s also not relevant to my main point. So meh. I might write something on it later. 

### SSRIs and GI Disorders

According to an article written by Christine B. Dalton, PA-C and Douglas A. Drossman, MD, “There are more than twenty functional disorders of the GI tract. Of these, IBS is the most common and most thoroughly studied.”[^19]

> “These disorders are characterized by abnormal changes in the movement of the muscles of the intestines (abnormal motility), an increase in the sensations produced by intestinal activity (visceral hypersensitivity), and brain-gut dysfunction, especially difficulties in the brain's ability to regulate painful signals from the GI tract. With IBS, a person's awareness and interpretation of these activities may be abnormal (abnormal perception).”[^20]

**Abnormal motility** essentially refers to how the muscles in the intestine move. Many IBS patients “experience spasms and cramping.”[^21] If motility is too fast, diarrhea can result. If motility is too slow, constipation can result. Both of these symptoms can result in pain, bloating, and unexacting trips to the rest room on a very frequent basis.[^22]

**Visceral hypersensitivity** occurs when the nerves in the intestinal tracts have increase sensitivity.[^23] This may occur in patients who have just had intestinal surgery. The result of visceral hypersensitivity may result in individuals eating less due to the discomfort of a stretching stomach even from small amounts of food.[^24]

**Brain-Gut Dysfunction**
In order to fully understand brain-gut dysfunction, we have to discuss the brain gut axis. 

### The Brain Gut Axis

According to Marilia Carabotti and their colleagues, author of “The gut-brain axis: interactions between enteric microbiota, central and enteric nervous systems”, “The gut-brain axis (BGA) consists of bidirectional communication between the central and enteric nervous system, linking emotional and cognitive centers of the brain with peripheral intestinal functions.”[^25]

According to the author of “The Simplified Guide to the Gut-Brain Axis— How the Gut and The Brain Talk to Each Other”, “The GBA involves complex crosstalk between the endocrine (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA)), immune (cytokine and chemokines), and the autonomy nervous system (ANS).”…The HPA axis meanwhile coordinates adaptive responses against stress, including activation of memory and emotional centers in the brain’s limbic system.”[^26] 

According to Christopher Bergland, author of “The Vagus Nerve May Carry Serotonin Along the Gut-Brain Axis”, “As part of the bidirectional gut-brain axis, afferent vagal nerves send signals from the bottom-up.”[^27]

> “There is reason to believe that these vagus nerve pathways might serve as a type of ‘serotonin superhighway’ between the gut and the brain.”[^28]

Bergland continues, “In recent years, researchers…have been investigating the possible link between SSRI antidepressant medications, serotonin levels in the gut, and the role that vagus nerve stimulation might play in boosting gut-to-brain transport of serotonin, which appears to rely on the vagus nerve…In a recent interview with Canadian Press published on October 4, 2019, first author Karen, Anne McVey Neufeld said, ‘This [research] opens the door for examining the gut and the continuous communication that happens between the gut and the brain.’ She also said that her team’s findings ‘suggest the gut may play a larger role in depression that previously believed and the latest research hints at new treatment possibilities in the future’.”[^29]

## More Nervous System Stuff

### The Enteric Nervous System

Remember how [I said the autonomic nervous system](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/Science-of-Meditation) was split into two branches, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system? Well, I lied. Kind of.

Your gastrointestinal tract is governed by a system of neurons classified in it’s own branch of the autonomic nervous system called the enteric nervous system (ENS) (AKA the intrinsic nervous system). [^30] The ENS acts totally independently of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. However it can be influenced by them. 

The ENS is referred to by many as the “second brain” or “the brain in the gut”.[^31] 

> This is because it can act, and I cannot stress this enough, *totally independently of the brain and spinal cord*.[^32]

The ENS can act completely independently of the central nervous system. 

According to the authors of “‘Second Brain’ Neurons Keep Colon Moving”, “It has also been called the ‘first brain’ based on evidence suggesting that the ENS evolved before the CNS.”[^33]

Obviously, there’s way more to discuss here, but I feel like you know enough about the enteric system now to understand series 4 and 5. So I’m going to move on for the sake of this already being long. 

## Back to the Gut

### Brain-Gut Dysfunction

According to Dalton and Drossman, “When the nerve impulses from the gut reach the brain, they may be experienced as more severe or less severe based on the regulatory activities of the brain-gut axis. Signals of pain or discomfort travel from the intestines up to the brain. The brain has the ability to “turn down” the pain by sending signals that block the nerve impulses produced in the GI tract.”[^34]

Dalton and Drossman have recorded instances in which IBS actually impairs this “turn down the pain” ability. 

> “In addition,” they continue, “the pain can become more severe when an individual is experiencing psychological distress.”[^35]

If you have IBS and you’ve ever wondered why your stomach hurts 3 times worse when you’re stressed (whether it be from life or actual stomach problems).[^36] THIS (might be) IS WHY. 

### So How Do SSRIs Help With IBS?

Again, I’ll let Dalton and Drossman explain, “The brain is always monitoring and processing all that goes on in the body. As already noted, antidepressants are known to work at the level of the brain and spinal cord to block pain messages between the GI tracts and the brain, thereby reducing visceral hypersensitivity.”[^37]

> “In effect, there is recovery of more normal brain-gut function, possibly be helping the brain send down signals to block incoming pain impulses, a natural response. Much like treating diabetes with the insulin that is missing, antidepressants may help recover the brain’s ability to respond to pain signals properly.”[^38]

Dr. Nicolas J Talley, M.D., Ph.D., author of “SSRIs in IBS: Sensing a dash of disappointment,” notes, “The prescription of antidepressants for IBS is primarily based on [three] propositions. First, antidepressants could reduce the severity of comorbid psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression may exacerbate the symptoms of IBS and promise consulting behavior, although recent population-based studies have failed to confirm the dogma that psychological distress largely explains health care seeking in IBS. There is evidence that anxiety and depression may also be etiologically linked to the syndrome, although this to remains controversial and probably only applies in a subset. Second, antidepressants have central analgesic actions, and there is increasing evidence of CNS dysfunction in IBS, based, for example, on changes in cerebral blood flow in response to rectal distention. Sleep is often disturbed in IBS; antidepressants reduce affective arousal and have sleep restorative actions. Thirdly, these drugs theoretically may have local gut pharmacological actions modulating sensorimotor function, although here data are limited.”[^39]

Remember how I mentioned Serotonin is actually most prevelent in the gut?

And do you remember how I mentioned that SSRIs work by blocking the uptake of the neurotransmitter (specially 5 hydroxytryptamine (5HT))? 

Great. 

In his article, Dr. Talley mentions, “This occurs not just in the brain but also in the gut. Serotonin is an important gut neuromodulator. Hence increase local presence of 5HT in the gut following [serotonin transporter] (SERT) inhibition will lead to stimulation of multiple 5HT receptors, especially 5HT3 and 5HT4, that in turn may alter motor and sensory function.[^40]

All of that is to say, with the use of SSRIs not only do you have more serotonin in your brain (potentially helping renew your brain’s pain blocking super power), but you have more serotonin in your gut—which we know from our new knowledge on the enteric system—can work independently of the brain and spinal cord.

While the research (and proof) that SSRIs can help IBS sufferers, Talley points out 2 studies that may point in a positive direction.[^41] 

Talley writes, “Chial et al. tested venlafaxine in healthy volunteers, which at the dose used (150 mg) inhibits both 5HT and some norepinephrine (NE) reuptake. A sophisticated protocol assessed left colonic sensation, including the application of randomized order phasic distentions with the barostat. Venlafaxine reduced colonic compliance and relaxed the colon, reduced the normal increased colonic tone response to feeding, and reduced colonic sensation. The changes observed theoretically may accrue a benefit in IBS; up to 50% of patients with IBS report symptom exacerbations after a meal, and visceral hypersensitivity is considered a key abnormality in IBS.”[^42] 

I could literally quote this whole article to you, but I’m not. Instead we’ll get to the good part. 

“In conclusion,” Talley writes, “there are tantalizing data that the SSRIs may have a modest benefit in IBS but conclusive evidence is lacking.”[^43] 

> If SSRIs are efficacious in IBS, primary central mechanism of action seems most plausible, but peripheral effects may still contribute, particularly in view of the huge amounts of 5HT stored by the enterochromaffin cells.”[^44]

### It’s Electric
Enterochromaffin, for those that don’t know (read: me), are a type of specialized cell that live in the GI tract that play a large role in endocrine function. They also receive neural input that trigger the release of hormones. They are typically found on the outside of the lumen (opening of the tube-like structure that is your intestines) of the intestinal tract.[^45]

Constanza Alcaino et al., authors of “A population of gut epithelial enterochromaffin cells is mechanosensitive and requires Piezo2 to convert force into serotonin release”, argue that these enterochromaffin (EC) cells are also “mechanosensory cells  that release serotonin in response to epithelial forces, and thereby regulate intestinal fluid secretion.”[^46]

Basically, Constanza Alcaino et al. argued that these EC cells response to mechanical stimulation. 

They tried to see if EE cells produced more serotonin by running volts of electrify to them. 

After all, every movement we make inside or our of our body has an electrical current. 

They concluded that yes, at least “subsets of… primary EC cells are mechanosensitive (about 60%).”[^47]

Therefore, EE cells can produce more serotonin when volts of electricity are run through them.

## Vagal Stimulation

Let’s backtrack a little bit. Remember how I basically quoted all of Christopher Bergland’s article about how vagal stimulation might help the distribution of serotonin via the gut-brain axis? 

Yeah, I do too. You’re so attentive, dear reader. 

Anyway, Alcaino’s test of electrical impulses kind of proves this theory…kind of. 

If you’ll remember the vagus nerve runs down into the belly, and it bypasses the   CNS. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that vagal stimulation can aid in increases serotonin levels in the gut. 

If you don’t remember the number one way to stimulate the vagus nerve. Just you wait until part 5 of this series…or read [this](https://www.emilywyattsmiley.com/breathing). 

(This will be important in part five of this series. For now, let that shit marinate.)

## Serotonin and the Bacteria In Your Belly

Okay, we’ve briefly touched on the fact that serotonin mostly resides in your gut. Let’s go back to that.

### There’s Bacteria In Your Belly. Don’t Worry. It’s A Good Thing.

According to Dr. Siri Carpenter, author of “That gut feeling”, an article for the *American Psychological Association*, “If aliens were to swoop in from outer space and squeeze a human down to see what we’re made of, they would come to the conclusion that cell for cell, we’re mostly bacteria.”[^48]

The human gut is sterile at birth.[^49] “But,” Carpenter explains, “over time, everyone’s gut develops a diverse and distinct brew of bacterial species, determined in part by genetics and in part by what bacteria live in and on those around us.”[^50]

> “In fact, single-celled organisms—mostly bacteria—outnumber our own cells [ten] to one, and most of them make their home in the gut. The gut, in turn, has evolved a stunningly complex neural network capable of leveraging this bacterial ecosystem for the sake of both physical and psychological well-being.”[^51]

Neuroimmunologist John Bienenstock, M.D., explains that only in the last decade or so have researchers begun to explore how much the gut microbiome can influence such as “neural development, brain chemistry and a wide range of behavioral phenomena, including emotional behavior, pain perception, and how the stress system responds.”[^52]

“Research has found, for example, that tweaking the balance between beneficial and disease-causing bacteria in an animal’s gut can alter its brain chemistry and lead it to become either more bold or more anxious. The brain can also exert a powerful influence on gut bacteria; as many studies have shown, even mild stress can tip the microbial balance in the gut, making the host more vulnerable to infectious disease and triggering a cascade of molecular reactions that feed back to the central nervous system.”[^53]

The gut biome could be an entirely other article, and it very well might be, but for now all we need to know is that there is bacteria in your belly and current research suggests that that microbial balance can affect not the hormones created in your intestines—such as serotonin. 


### Back to Serotonin

We previously discussed that Serotonin is created in the belly by EC and EE cells. 

Just as the gut biome can affect the amount of serotonin in your system, having more serotonin can affect your gut biome. 

According to Stuart Wolpert, author of “Study shows how serotonin and a popular anti-depressant affect the gut’s microbiota,” “A new study in mice led by UCLA biologists strongly suggests that serotonin and drugs that target serotonin, such as anti-depressants can have a major effect on the gut’s microbiota."[^54]

Wolpert continues, “The team—led by senior author Elaine Hsiao and lead author Thomas Fung, a postdoctoral fellow — identified a specific gut bacterium that can detect and transport serotonin into bacterial cells. When mice were given the antidepressant fluoxetine, or prozac, the biologists found this reduced the transport of serotonin into their cells. This bacterium, about which little is known, is called Turicibacter sanguinis.”[^55]

What does this mean?

Thomas Fun answers, “‘Previous studies from our lab and others showed that specific bacteria promote serotonin levels in the gut,’ Fung said. ‘Our new study tells us that certain gut bacteria can respond to serotonin and drugs that influence serotonin, like anti-depressants. This is a unique form of communication between bacteria and our own cells through molecules traditionally recognized as neurotransmitters.’[^56]

Okay, I find this seriously fascinating, but this is a bit of a rabbit hole. So, I’m just going to give you a little bit of a sprinkling of it for your own edification, and say….

### One Last Thing

Let’s go back to Carpenter’s article, “That gut feeling”. 

I really want to connect all of this back to the vagus nerve--because it is truly all connected. 

Carpenter writes, “How could gut bacteria influence the brain and behavior so profoundly?…In other studies, Bienenstock and others have found that at least in some cases bacteria communicate with the brain via the vagus nerve: When the vagus nerve is severed, effects of gut bacteria on brain biochemistry, stress response and behavior evaporate.”[^57] 

>  “Those findings not only shed light on how bacteria may influence the brain, but also fit with other work in humans that suggest that vagal stimulation can be used as a last resort for treating depression. ‘This opens up the idea that once we learn how the bacteria talk to the vagus, we may be able to stimulate that with novel molecule —drugs without the bacteria,’ Bienenstock says.”[^58]

Carpenter continues to write, “[Microbiologist Mark] Lyte, in a 2011 BioEssays paper, proposed a neurochemical ‘delivery system’ by which gut bacteria, such as probiotics, can send messages to the brain. Gut bacteria both produce and respond to the same neurochemicals—such as GABA, serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, acetylcholine and melatonin—that the brain uses to regulate mood and cognition. Such neurochemicals probably allow the brain to tune its behavior to the feedback it receives from the army of bacteria in the gut.”[^59] 

“‘And why not?’ asks Lyte. After all, he says, considering the sheer abundance of bacteria awash in the human gut, ‘wouldn't it make sense that your brain would want to keep tabs on it?’ Just how that communication unfolds is an open question, however. ‘We're really at the beginning of trying to understand how everything links up,’ Lyte says. What is clear already, he says, is that ‘it's a very interactive environment, much more so than we ever expected when we were trying to understand these things as stand-alone systems.’”[^60]

> It’s all freaking connected.[^61]

### Next Time on The Science Of Meditation
Next week we’ll talk about Dopamine and NDRIs. I might even try to explain why pharmaceuticals decided prescribing adrenaline reuptake meds for people with anxiety was a good idea. We’ll see.[^62]
