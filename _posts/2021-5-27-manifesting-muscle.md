I was in yoga teacher training last month, and someone mentioned a study that proved just *thinking* about exercise can make us physically stronger.
Let’s just say I had a hard time believing them. 

But, I’m not here to call anyone a liar. 

So, I researched.

Turns out, they were right.

> And, now my mind is blown.

(Before we get too deep into this, please understand two things:
1. I am not a doctor. I am researching to better understand these concepts myself. I write these blogs to help myself learn and to hopefully help ignite your curiosity about these topics.
2. When I discuss any kind of brain/body system I am referring to a healthy, able brain/body without injury, illness, or disability unless otherwise specified. I do this to ensure that I get my information as accurate as possible. Once I start digging into disabilities, illnesses, and injuries, things get significantly more complicated, and, like I said in my first point, I’m not a doctor.
Okay, good chat.)

## One Evolutionary Unit

My friend in teacher training was right. 

Brain C. Clark and colleagues conducted a study that showed just *thinking* about exercise can make us stronger.[^1] 

Clayton Mosher, author of “How to Grow Stronger Without Lifting Weights” explains, 

> “Clark and colleagues recruited 29 volunteers and wrapped their wrists in surgical casts for an entire month. During this month, half of the volunteers thought about exercising their immobilized wrists. For 11 minutes a day, 5 days a week, they sat completely still and focused their entire mental effort on pretending to flex their muscles. When the casts were removed, the volunteers that did mental exercises had wrist muscles that were *two times stronger than those that had done nothing at all*.[^2] 

In the abstract of the study, Clark et al notes, “These findings suggest neurological mechanisms, most likely at the cortical level, contribute significantly to disuse-induced weakness, and that regular activation of the cortical regions via imagery attenuates weakness and VA [voluntary activation] by maintaining normal level of inhibition.”[^3]

In other words, visualizing a muscle movement can help build that muscle. 

This isn't the onlly study that proves this either.

Mosher notes, “Ten years ago, Guang Yue at the Cleveland Clinic reported that imaginary exercise increased the strength of fingers muscles by up to 35%…Kai Miller at the University of Washington, showed that imaginary exercise activated the same brain areas that are activated during real exercise.”[^4]

Some studies have even proved that imaginary exercise can be enough to raise your heart rate.[^5]

Clark’s study just proves this concept even further.

Mosher points out that this isn’t a new idea, but it’s something that gets easily forgotten. 

In society, we separate the mind from the body. In fact, some people are described as having strength in one but not the other, example: brain vs brawn.[^6]

> But, the brain and the body evolved as one unit—not two separate entities.

You can keep the body active by keeping the mind active. They are connected. Woven together so tightly, I barely have to think about writing this sentence at all. I mean, I’m thinking about it now because I told myself not to think about it. Now it’s all I can think about. 

Oh, God! What have I done?!

## Other Perks Of Visualization

I learned to play the piano as a young kid. I played throughout grade school. In high school, I dabbled in a few competitions, tried out for competitive musical schools and programs (and got into some (humble brag)), and, of course, my piano teacher hosted a recital every spring in which her students were expected to perform. I always had to have my music memorized. Something I struggled with, honestly. But, I hated disappointing my piano teacher when I didn’t have a piece memorized by my deadline. So, I had to figure out a way to practice more without frying my brain by physically practicing for several hours after school.

I remember being bored in school sometimes and literally practicing piano in my head. Visualizing the notes, how the paper the sheet music was printed on smelled and felt as I turned the page, the feel of the keys beneath my fingers. I remember mentally watching my fingers move across the keys. I remember feeling my joints twitch as I mentally went over the more complicated runs. If my was really in it and I was truly focused, it would help me with my practice session later that day.

Visualization is not an uncommon practive in a competitive setting. In fact, a lot of people do it.[^7] Ask any competitive athete.


For example, rock climbers literally visualize the routes they are about to climb. If you go to a rock climbing gym, you might see people staring at the wall and making these weird moves with their arms and legs as they imagine what the route expects of them. Every grip, every twist of the hip, every dynamic movement is visualized before they even get on the wall.

Jim Davies, author of _Just Imagining A Workout Can Make You Stronger_, writes, “Mental practice is one of the few effective performance enhancing activities. For example, doctors who mentally practice before engaging in a virtual-reality surgery outperform those who do not. One study, by Rutgers psychologist Rober Woolfolk, and colleagues, had people simply imagine putting a golf ball into the hole before they took their shot. The people who imagined making it had 30.4 percent more successful putts than those who did not.”[^8]

It’s a very real strategy. And now it’s proven to work on a musculoskeletal level *and* a psychological level. 

Elizabeth Quinn, author of _Do Visualization Exercises Help Build Strength?_ writes, “…The general practice increases confidence and helps build the pathways in the nervous system that are aligned with reducing anxiety and distractions. Others point to the athlete’s ability to improve focus and attention and, much like a meditation, the mental visualization is not that different from actual physical rehearsal in that it helps an athlete prepare for their sport.”[^9]

## Proprioceptive Training & Building Out New Neural Pathways

As a yoga teacher and a personal trainer, I give a lot of cues to specific muscles. I remember I was teaching a private student, a runner, one day and I noticed he wasn’t really using his upper body for much. 

I was like, “Hey, Client, engage your lats when you go a specific yoga pose.”

And he said, “I don’t know how.”

That’s when I realized my client and I had an entirely new and exciting thing to work on: building a stronger neural pathway to help him flex his lats in isolation. 

A neural pathway is created in the brain when you learn something new.[^10] The more you do the thing that created the neural pathway, the easier it is to perform. That is muscle memory.[^11] Every movement you make is the function of a neural pathway.

Okay, take this journey with me.

You pull off the side of the road and decide to go for a walk in the woods. There's no clear cut trail, but you go anyway. We'll call the point where you start your hike Point A. After a while you find a waterfall: Point B.

The path to the waterfall is unclear though. There’s a lot of foliage. It’s a bit rocky. The trek was unpleasant, and difficult. But damn if that waterfall is beautiful, fulfilling, and makes you feel successful. So, you keep going. You notice the more you walk back and forth on the trail from Point A to Point B and back again, the more obvious and wider the trail becomes.

Eventually, you decide you want to build a log cabin at Point B, and you create a dirt driveway from Point A to Point B.

Then you realize you love your log cabin and want to build a bigger house there. since you're there more often, you need a paved road. Something that's easier to get back and forth on.

Now your dirt driveway from Point A to Point B is a paved, two-lane road.

Then, you realize your kids need a school, and you would like a grocery store closer. You’ve essentially created a town (or a cult), and now you create a highway from Point A to Point B. Traffic along the pathway is ever-moving and easy. You can basically drive from Point A to Point B with your eyes closed.[^12] 

That’s how neural pathways are formed. The more you perform an action, the wider the neural pathway becomes, the easier it is for the neurons in your brain to travel to, and communicate with, your muscles. Thus, the task will be success more frequently.[^13] 

That’s essentially what practicing is meant to do. If you’re trying to throw a three-pointer, you’re going to suck at first, probably. But, the more you do it, the less you have to consider the mechanics of the movement, and before you know it, your a freaking 3-pointer throwing master.[^14]

This evolution of progress is called plasticity. It is the brains ability to create and strengthen new connections.[^15]

All of that is to say visualizing the movement of a muscle can help create and strengthen neural pathways and cultivate better proprioception (the awareness of position and movement of the body) within the body.[^16]

My client who didn’t understand how to engage his lats, had to stop and think about how to do that. I told him to think about doing a pull up. I watched his back muscles engage. Once I noticed his lats flexing I said, “That right there! That was it. Do it again!” Once he the neural pathway was created and strengthened he was able to engage his lats (with some thought at first mind you) over and over again. 

### Plasticity and Brain Degeneration

Dr. Michael Merzenich, a leading pioneer in brain plasticity research, writes, 
> “The brain changes physically, functionally, and chemically, as you acquire any ability or skill. You know this instinctively. Something must be changing as your abilities improve, or as new abilities emerge. You are actually remodeling your brain machinery by ‘practicing’ the skill, those physical changes account for your learning. 

> Actually what the brain is doing is changing its local wiring, changing the details of how the machinery controlling your behavior is connected. It’s also changing itself in other physical, chemical, and functional ways. Collectively, those changes account for the improvement or acquisition of any human ability.

> You probably haven’t realized it, but as you acquire an ability — for example, the ability to read—you have actually created a system in the brain that does not exist, that’s not in place, in the non-reader. It [the ability; the brain system that controls the ability] actually evolves in you as it has been acquired through experience or learning.”[^17]

The brain and body evolve and learn together.

Furthermore, this proves that the brain is literally designed to be pushed and challenged. It is literally made to be constantly learning. It *needs* to be constantly learning.

As a child, you *are* constantly learning. At first, you are learning to walk, talk, regulate emotions, and just generally be human being. Then, if you’re lucky, you go to school for the better half of two decades. 

As adulthood is reach, and settled into, the learning, generally, slows. Things that were once new and fresh can now run on autopilot. You are generally just using the same abilities you’ve now known for three to four decades. Dr. Merzenich believes this is the cause for cognitive decline.[^18] 

> To a large extent, you’re operating most of your day without really being consciously engaged in the things you’re doing. You’re substantially disengaged: ‘sleepwalking through life.’[^19]

It was once believed that brain aging was an inevitable process. As you get older, the brain slows. It takes longer to comprehend basic stimuli. It was believed it was a process that just kind of happened to everybody. Those who seemed very coherent until they passed? Well, they just had good genes. The were an anomaly.

Natalie T. Y. Leung and colleagues, authors of _Neural Plastic Effects of Cognitive Training on Aging Brain_, write, “Increasing research has evidence that our brain retains a capacity to change in response to experience until late adulthood. This implies that cognitive training can possibly ameliorate age-associated cognitive decline by inducing training-specific neural plastic changes at both neural and behavioral levels.”[^20]

What does that mean? 

With the correct tools, cognitive decline can be reversed to a certain degree.

Dr. Mercola, author of _Use It or Lose It: The Principles of Brain Plasticity_, explains, “A key factor or ingredient necessary for improving brain function or reversing functional decline is the *seriousness of purpose* with which you engage in a task. In other words, the task must be important to you, or somehow meaningful or interesting—it must hold your attention.”[^21]

Well, I’ll be damned. That sounds a lot like visualization and the focus required to help build muscle without physically moving the fibers, no? 

Mercola continues, “Rote memorization of nonsensical or unimportant items or even heavy work at non-challenging tasks will not stimulate your brain to create new connections or neurons.”[^22]

> Your brain won’t put in the work to improve if it doesn’t give a shit about the work.[^23]

If you go into the Apple Store™ and look up “brain training” you will see a ton of apps that honestly just kind of look like games. 

Some people refer to these as “brain gyms”.

> “I like to break a mental sweat, too.” —White Goodman—[^24]

Why games though? 

Dr. Merzenich writes, “We know that rewards have to occur, or information or feedback about how you’re doing have to occur, in a specific and timely way to drive the optimum changes in the brain. The way difficulties change in the task are also crucial for driving changes with highest proficiency. One simple thing we do is to [continually] adjust the difficulty level of the task, so that every trainee is at a level in which they get most things correct but they’re still capable of error. Because only when you’re in this demanding situation, only when it matters to the brain, does the machinery turn on to change the brain.”[^25]

In order for the brain to care is must work toward something important, and what’s more important than a little competition?

There’s a metric shit ton of these “brain gyms” available on smart phones now. I’m not going to push any specific one here.[^26]

Who needs to practice these brain games? 

Mercola answers: 

> “Everybody’s brain is plastic, including yours, so no matter what age or current level of brain function, your brain can improve to some degree or another…Children operating in the 10th to 20th percentile of academic performance are commonly able to improve their scores to the middle or average level with 20-30 hours of intensive computer-based training…Careful controlled studies in seniors have also been reported in scientific journals. After 40 hours of computer-based training, the average improvement in cognitive performance across the board was 14 years. On average, if you were 70 years old when you underwent the training after 30 hours of brain training, your cognitive abilities operated like that of a 56-year old. Equally strong or even greater effects were seen in 40 to 50 year olds using the program.”[^27]

My grandmother was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago. Knowing dementia can be hereditary, I started practicing brain games every morning for about ten minutes a morning a few months ago.[^28] It has significantly helped my ability to add and subtract things quickly (math was never my strong suit), recognize faces and remember names, and recall where I put things. No bullshit. It really does help.

Please understand, I’m not saying an app on your phone is a cure to all brain degeneration. I’m also not saying that if you practice these brain games you definitely are not going to get dementia or any other form cognitive disease. Those would be crazy-pants things to say. 

I am relaying facts to you that I’ve found in my research. 

One such article is _Use it or lose it? More research suggests that mental activity may stave off the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease_, written by Beth Azar, and published by the American Psychological Association. Azar writes, “There seems to be mounting evidence that a lifetime of learning, mental and physical activity, and rewarding work is good for people. That finding also appears to be true when it comes to warding off Alzheimer’s disease.”[^29] 

Azar continues, “Neuropsychologists, along with teams of neurologists, neuroscientists, behavioral neurologists and other medical researchers are beginning to piece together data that point to the idea that keeping the brain active and stimulated may reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. 

I’m not going to talk about Alzheimer’s much more than this because the truth is, scientists still don’t really know what causes it or how to help it. There’s so many factors when it comes to degeneration among “diseased” brains, it’s hard to boil things down to such a micro level. And if *they* don’t know, I sure as hell won’t know. So, I’ll just leave you with this thought, science is now telling you playing a specific game on your phone for 10-20 minutes a day will help with brain health and stave off age-related brain degeneration. Why *wouldn’t* you take advantage of the down time? 

I mean hell, it’s for science!

With that acknowledgement, and brain games aside, what I’m really reading in all of this is:
1.  The brain *needs* to be challenged.
2. The brain needs to *want* said challenge. 
3. Being active both mentally and physically is *key* to a healthy brain.
4. Variety is *required* in order for any of this to actually benefit us at all. 

### Variety Is Essential

There is this phenomenon in the exercise world called “adaptive resistance”.[^30] Physical Therapist Brian Magat, author of “The Importance of Variety in Creating Your Exercise Program”, explains, “Adaptive resistance is when you have done an exercise over a long period of time, and your body no longer responds to it…By creating variation and changing exercises in your routine, you can create new stimulus, which creates more progress over time.”[^31] 

That new stimulus is what allows the brain to create new neural pathways. In creating variety every so often in your workouts, or even your typical daily routines, you are asking the brain and body to evolve together and grow stronger.

In case you’re curious about building your own work out regimen, here’s a tip from Magat, “When choosing exercises in a program, two to three variations should be chosen for each muscle or movement.”[^32]

(Say what you will about Tony Horton, but P90X actually uses variety in a very intelligent way both in his specific workouts and over time in his three-month program. If you’re looking for an example, check out the P90X workout schedule. Magat also provides examples [here](https://www.uhhospitals.org/Healthy-at-UH/articles/2020/08/the-importance-of-variety-in-creating-your-exercise-program).)

### Couch Potatoes Unite! 

Okay, before you start making your couch potato propaganda, let’s pull back a little bit. Strength training is still extremely important for a healthy body and mind. As Quinn notes, “Sport-specific exercises are still the most effective method for building and maintain muscle strength, speed, power, and coordination.”[^33]

Besides, like I alluded to before, and I’m reinforcing with this quote from Jim Davies right now, it’s been proven “that 20 minutes is the optimal amount of time for a mental practice session, according to a meta-analysis of many physical activities. Any less or more and the practice doesn’t stick as well.”[^34]

> “Mental practice is a supplement, not an alternative.”[^35]

Let’s put it this way. If you broke your leg and you can’t do squats, ask yourself to truly focus on every muscle, every tendon, every ligament, moving your body to do a squat. Do that for about twenty minutes a day, five times a week, and you might not lose the muscle mass your doctor was probably expecting. 

But if you can do squats, then by all means do the damn squats. 

And, maybe throw in a brain game during your rest intervals just to keep things spicy.
