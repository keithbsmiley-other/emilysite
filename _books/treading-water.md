&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dallas London’s brother drowned off the coast of Maui, and she might be losing her mind. At least, that was her first thought when she started hearing the voices. As her hallucinations worsen, she’s left wondering if she would have been better off as the one who sunk into the Pacific abyss.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now back home in San Francisco after looking for her brother’s body, Dallas learns someone else has gone missing, triggering her in a big way. She hallucinates a monster during her therapy appointment. And again in the bathroom of her favorite bar. And, oh yeah, she thought she heard a weird voice in her ex-boyfriend’s apartment this morning, but it was probably nothing. Because monsters aren’t real. *Deny, deny, deny* becomes her mantra until her imaginary monster actually tries to kill her. <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter: Death. The grim reaper. The Soul Collector. *That* Death. In the form of a snarky, sexy woman, Death presents Dallas with a proposition: find out who is stealing the souls of the drowned, in exchange for protection from the demon hunting Dallas. Desperate, she accepts Death's offer. The cost includes a quick trip to Hell—no big deal since she has been in hell since her brother died. But it will also force her to face her grief, which is enough to make her wish she'd been the one to sink into the Pacific.
