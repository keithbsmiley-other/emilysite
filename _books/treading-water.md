&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dallas London's brother is presumed dead after going missing off the coast of Maui. Now back home in San Francisco, Dallas does denial in style: no sleep and a steady diet of stale pizza, cigarettes, and intrusive thoughts about her brother’s decaying body. But when a philanthropist’s son disappears under eerily similar circumstances and Dallas starts seeing demons lurking in the shadows of her apartment, even she can’t pretend she’s fine. <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter: Death. In the form of a snarky, sexy young woman, Death is drawn to Dallas’s issues just as much as Dallas is drawn to Death’s mysterious magnetism. Desperate, Dallas makes a deal with Death: Dallas will find out who is stealing the souls of the drowned, in exchange for protection from the demon hunting her. The cost? Dallas must come to terms with her incredible loss, even though it makes her wish she’d been the one to sink in the Pacific abyss.
