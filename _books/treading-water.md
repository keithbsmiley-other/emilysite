Dallas London's brother is dead. He drowned off the coast of Maui. Now back home in San Francisco, she barely sleeps, and a steady diet of stale pizza, Twinkies, and Lucky Strikes aren’t helping. Even worse, someone else in the Bay area has gone missing, triggering Dallas in a big way. She hallucinates a monster, but it was probably nothing. Because monsters aren't real. *Deny, deny, deny* becomes her mantra until her imaginary monster tries to actually kill her. Enter: Death. A snarky, sexy young woman who presents Dallas with a proposition. The cost includes a quick trip to Hell—not a big deal; Dallas has been in hell since her brother died. But it will also force her to face her grief—which is enough to make her wish she'd been the one to sink into the Pacific abyss.

Treading Water came in first place in the Horror category of the 2024 PNWA Unpublished Novel Contest.
