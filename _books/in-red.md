&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-three-year-old Annabeth Jefferds has spent her entire adult life trying to de-program the lessons she learned as a child of the South: stay quiet, do what you’re told, don’t ask questions. She has it pretty good living in Seattle now. She no longer feels the stress of living under a roof with her emotionally reclusive father and playing mother to her little sister, Bean. Things are looking up until Annabeth receives a phone call. Bean is sick and her father is MIA. Annabeth must go back to her family home, Hellebore Manor.
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more time Annabeth spends at Hellebore, the more she realizes there’s something strange going on. Built in the 1700s, the massive plantation home had always been meticulously cared for. Now, the house is so decrepit it looks like it’s dying. Kudzu is climbing the exterior walls. The wallpaper is peeling like flakes of skin. And the once perfectly polished wood accents throughout the house are cracking. Annabeth also thinks she sees strange animals lurking on the edge of the forest, but that can’t be. Rabbits don’t have human thumbs for ears and deer couldn’t have human arms growing out of their neck. Annabeth is imagining things. Meanwhile, Bean spends her days lying in bed, in and out of coherent thought, and their father wastes his time on the property’s lake, fishing and muttering to himself. 
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at Hellebore, Annabeth learns that southern roots run deep, and they'll always pull you back down.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below is a running playlist that gets me in the mood to work on this book.
