&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyana and her panther-like familiar escaped the king’s prison after learning Lyana’s sister, Astrea, was murdered. But running isn’t easy after being starved, tortured and drugged by the king’s necromancer and closest advisor, Videl. Not to mention the life-threatening injury Lyana’s familiar sustained during their prison break. Lyana’s life is tied to her familiar’s. If one dies, they both do. With no support or resources, Lyana’s only hope is to trust a passing mage. He heals them and reveals that Astrea still lives and is said to be traveling to a temple housing incredibly strong ancient magic. <br/> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyana, her familiar, and the mage set out to find Astrea, but are dogged by the king’s men and plagued by an evil sorceress infecting Lyana’s thoughts and dreams. On her journey, Lyana attracts rebellious allies—including the mage that saved her, a young knight who idolizes her, and a clan of shape-shifting werebears—who view her as a symbol of revolution—a role that she doesn’t want or need. They arrive at the temple, but are ambushed. With the misguided hopes of Lyana eventually leading them to some sort of insurgency, the rebels join her on her quest. But when they arrive at the temple, Lyana learns that no one in her life is to be trusted—especially her own family.
