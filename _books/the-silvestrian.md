&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyana has just escaped from the king’s dungeons with her panther-like familiar, Kess. But Kess took an arrow during their prison break. With their lives tied to each other, they now both only have hours to live. The escape, the murders Lyana had been forced to commit while captive, it may have all been for nothing.<br/> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dying and hunted by the king’s men, Lyana is desperate. Until she meets a mage who happens to be an adept healer. Reluctant, she allows the mage to help. After saving the lives of both Lyana and Kess, the mage tells Lyana that her sister is actually alive and traveling to a temple housing incredibly strong ancient magic. Lyana’s plans to stay on the run quickly change. She has to find and protect her sister. During her search, Lyana comes across several rebellious allies who view her escape from the king as a symbol of revolution—a role she doesn’t want or need. With the misguided hopes of Lyana eventually leading them to some sort of insurgency, the rebels join her on her quest. But when they arrive at the temple, Lyana learns that no one in her life is to be trusted—especially her own family.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silvestrian is book one in a planned trilogy. Below is a running playlist that gets me in the mood to work on this book.<br/>
