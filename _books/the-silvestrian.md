Dying and hunted by the king’s men, Lyana is desperate. Until she meets a mage who happens to be an adept healer. Reluctant, she allows the mage to help. After saving the lives of both Lyana and Kess, the mage tells Lyana that her sister is actually alive and traveling to a temple housing incredibly strong ancient magic. Lyana’s plans to stay on the run quickly change. She has to find and protect her sister. During her search, Lyana comes across several rebellious allies who view her escape from the king as a symbol of revolution—a role she doesn’t want or need. With the misguided hopes of Lyana eventually leading them to some sort of insurgency, the rebels join her on her quest. But when they arrive at the temple, Lyana learns that no one in her life is to be trusted—especially her own family.
