Emily Smiley, is a horror and dark fantasy author who encourages her readers to discover deeper truths within themselves through the exploration of fear, grief, and trauma, with a splash of dark humor and (sometimes) a little spice. Her novel, Treading Water, won the horror category of the 2024 PNWA Unpublished Competition, and is currently on submission. She’s a volunteer for the Writer’s Studio at the Bainbridge Artisan Resource Network on Bainbridge Island, WA, and a member of the Pacific Northwest Writers Association and the Horror Writers Association. She is represented by A.J. Van Belle at Booker Albert Literary Agency. When Emily isn’t giving her readers nightmares, she’s running, climbing rocks, traveling, or playing video games.
