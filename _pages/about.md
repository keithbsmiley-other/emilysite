Lovely to meet you! My name’s Emily. I’m a yoga teacher (E-ryt 200; YACEP) and a NASM Certified Personal Trainer with specialties in Correct Exercises and Nutrition. My ultimate goal is to help you feel just a little lighter than you did before class. I focus on safe practices with a strong anatomical focus. Therefore, my schedule offers everything from restorative yoga to weight lifting slash cardio classes and everything in between. Check out the schedule. Sign up for a class or two. I can’t wait to see you on your mat!
