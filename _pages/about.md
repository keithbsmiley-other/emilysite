Emily Smiley, a writer from South Carolina who now calls Seattle home, crafts stories that reflect the world back to her readers, inviting them to explore deeper truths within themselves. Her current work in progress, Treading Water, came in first in the horror category of the 2024 PNWA Unpublished Competition. She’s a volunteer for the Writer’s Studio at the Bainbridge Artisan Resource Network on Bainbridge Island, WA and a member of the Pacific Northwest Writers Association. She's also a founder of Content Hospital, a spec fic writers, critique, and marketing collective. When she’s not giving her readers nightmares, she’s running, traveling, or playing video games.
