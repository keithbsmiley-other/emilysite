Like most journeys, my trek into the fitness world has been a windy one. I believed I found my path last year when I started coaching and leading teacher trainings for budding yoga teachers. I loved guiding others along their own paths, and watching them grow along the way. Unforuntely, like it had for countless others, 2020 had something else in mind for me. I lost my stable teaching job, and, suddenly, I found myself wandering somewhat aimlessly once again. I had the knowledge. I had the experience. I just didn't know where to put it, or who would want it, anymore. 

Three months ago, a student, and friend, reached out to me. I lead a part of her teacher training experience in early 2019, and she wanted me to help continue to build her teaching chops. After a few sessions, I realized *she* was now the one guiding *me*. She rekindled something I had forgotten about myself: I love to help others feel *good*. 

Whatever *good* means to them. Successful. Healthy. Educated. Etc. 

After many conversations with mentors, friends, and family, I found myself diving head first into setting up online class times. Then, I started a newsletter. Then, I started a blog. 

Which leads me to right here. The place where your path and my path converge. The place where you and I officially meet. 

It is truly lovely to meet you. My name is Emily. I teach yoga (E-ryt 200). I lead a variety of fitness classes online (NASM Certified Personal Trainer). If you have never done yoga, or any other kind of fitness class, and want to take private sessions together so you feel more comfortable in the Zoom room, let's jump on a call. We'll chat just the two of us, and go from there. Have an old injury that you need a little help with? I got you (Specialty in Correct Exercises from NASM). Nutrition questions? I got you (NASM Certified Nutrition Coach). Dying for informational, yet hilarious (IMHO), blogs about the fitness world? I got you (BA:Journalism; MA:History). Want feedback on your yoga teaching? I got you (Yoga Alliance YACEP certified).

So, what do you say? Let's travel down this path together for a little while, and see where it leads. you never know. We might find some good along the way.
