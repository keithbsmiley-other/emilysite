Hi, I’m Emily. This blog used to be dedicated to fitness and health. But after not putting anything up in over a year, I decided to let this be my place to write about whatever I please. Topics will most likely include: the steps I’m taking to becoming a published fiction author, pop culture, video games, cooking, fitness, health, and being the care taker of an elderly dog who, I believe, is trying to systematically drive me insane.
