### Treading Water

Dallas London's brother is dead. He drowned off the coast of Maui. Now back home in San Francisco, Dallas has to learn how to cope. It isn't going well. Dallas barely sleeps, and a steady diet of stale pizza, Twinkies, and Lucky Strikes aren’t helping. Even worse, someone else in the Bay area has gone missing, triggering Dallas in a big way. She hallucinates a monster during her therapy appointment, but it was probably nothing. Because monsters aren't real. Deny, deny, deny becomes her mantra until her imaginary monster tries to actually kill her. Enter: Death. A snarky, sexy young woman who presents Dallas with a proposition. If Dallas finds out who is stealing the souls of the drowned, Death will protect Dallas from her very real monster problem. Desperate, she accepts Death's offer. The cost includes a quick trip to Hell—not a big deal; Dallas has been in hell since her brother died. But it will also force her to face her grief—which is enough to make her wish she'd been the one to sink into the Pacific abyss.
