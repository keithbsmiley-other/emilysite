# Monstrum of Cael 
### Book 1 in the Silvestrian Uprising Trilogy

After being forced to fight against Silvestrian warriors like herself in gladiatorial games, Lyana is left with nothing but guilt, shame, and loneliness. 

However, her life changes when she learns of another Silvestrian wandering through Cael. In an effort to redeem herself, Lyana vows to find and protect this mystery girl. Along the way, Lyana must face off against hordes of the kingâ€™s men and an evil sorceress hell bent on killing her. In order to stay alive and find the other Silvestrian, Lyana must tackle her own demons and fight for what is right, no matter the cost.
