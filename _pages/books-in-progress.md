#Monstrum of Cael 

Lyana, a newly anointed Silvestrian warrior, watched as the king of Cael burned her city to the ground. With assassination on her mind, Lyana gets herself thrown into the king’s dungeons where she is pitted against her own people in gladiatorial games for months on end. Abandoning her initial misguided plans, Lyana escapes the dungeons, and is left with nothing but guilt, shame, and loneliness. 

However, her life changes when she learns of another Silvestrian wandering through Cael. In an effort to redeem herself, Lyana vows to find and protect the other Silvestrian. Along the way, she must face off against hordes of the king’s men and an evil sorceress hell bent on killing her. In order to stay alive and find the other Silvestrian, Lyana must tackle her own demons and fight for what is right, no matter the cost.
