### The Silvestrian

THE SILVESTRIAN is a 115,000 word epic fantasy about Lyana, a fledgling Silvestrian warrior, who just escaped from the king’s dungeons with the only friend she has left in the world—a snarky, panther-like familiar named Kess. An arrow caught Kess during the getaway, but a mysterious mage appears just in time to save her life. The mage, Jasper, tells Lyana that her sister, who she believed to be dead, is alive and wandering the dangerous roads of Cael alone. The three of them set out to find and protect the girl—whoever she may be—despite the threat of being recaptured by the king’s men. Along the way, Lyana and her company must survive incessant attacks from soldiers and a mysterious sorceress determined to bring her back to the castle, dead or alive. As Lyana grows closer to Jasper, she reveals more about how she and Kess were kidnapped from their own sacred land, held captive in the dungeons, forced to fight in the king’s gladiator-like games against other Silvestrian warriors like herself, and, ultimately, why they risked everything to escape.[^1]
