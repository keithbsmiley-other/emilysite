*Working with Emily the last few months has been incredible for my growth as an instructor and yoga student. She inspires me to expand my knowledge of anatomy and teaches me how to cue with intelligence and intentionality. Love my sessions with her!* --Monica--

*I've been with Emily for four years now: from my first downward dog to my perfected crow's pose! I appreciate her knowledge, skills, and classes - where she goes, I will follow! I thoroughly enjoy her classes because she has diverse class options from all levels of yoga to weight lifting - you can mix it up or focus on one! I've loved her recent classes, because they have a mixture of all 3; my ADHD brain can follow through without being side tracked! I'm excited to see how her business and passion will evolve!* --Milla--

*I’ve had the awesome experience taking Emily’s power flow classes since she started teaching virtually. I have gotten so much out of taking her classes both for my body and mind. Emily is a wonderful and experienced teacher. It shows in her thoughtful sequencing and cues. She challenges me to get deeper in a pose and really highlights which muscle groups are being engaged; all the while encouraging me to do what feels best in my own body. I always feel energized and stronger after taking her class. I highly recommend her classes, you won’t be disappointed!* --Kim--

*I took my first private Zoom Stretch lesson with Emily today, and I already have some relief in my lower back!  This has been an ongoing issue of mine. I am glad I found someone who can direct me into correct movement. Thanks Emily!* --Denise--

*What I like is Emily’s style. She lets you know the next excercise that’s coming before she gets to it. That enables me to prepare and mentally be ready.  She provides that push you need during the workout to keep you motivated. I am looking forward to my next pump class. Thanks Emily.* --Dave--

*Emily’s classes always make me feel super balanced and grounded. It’s so obvious that she plans her sequences thoughtfully, and takes the time to guide you through each pose with clear cues. I have always appreciated how her classes feel both challenging and natural. And fun! I love taking Emily’s classes and would recommend to yogis of any experience level.* --Lillian--
